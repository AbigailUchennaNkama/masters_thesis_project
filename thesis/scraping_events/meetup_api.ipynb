But does it actually help when you\\'re writing real-time code? And what does it change in your day-to-day work?\\n\\nAfter three years of building real-time audio systems in Rust, Iâll share what really mattered to me after switching from C++. This talk is about the practical side: what got better, what stayed tricky, and how Rust actually helped me write safer and more reliable real-time audio code.\\n\\nStephan is a software engineer at ai\\\\|coustics\\\\, where he is responsible for the SDK that runs neural networks for real\\\\-time audio using a custom inference engine written in Rust\\\\. He previously studied at the Audio Communication Group at TU Berlin and has worked as a DSP and plug\\\\-in developer for u\\\\-he\\\\, Holoplot\\\\, and Neumann\\\\. In his spare time\\\\, he maintains open\\\\-source libraries and creates coding tutorials on YouTube\\\\.\\n\\n**From Physics to Pixels: How I Bootstrapped an Audioreactive AI Video Synth to 100K Users**\\nNicolai Klemke\\n\\nHow does a physicist end up building a leading audioreactive AI video synthesizer? In this talk, Iâll share my journey founding Neural Frames - a browser-based platform that empowers artists and musicians to create visually striking, audioreactive music videos using AI. Join me for a quick demo as we build a music video in minutes, explore the core technology, and discuss the exciting intersection of audio, AI, and creativity.',\n",

       "   'description': '**Making Accessibility More Accessible (with a Deck of Cards)**\\n\\nAccessibility guidelines are essential, but scattered, overwhelming, and not always practical for people or even teams in daily work. The WCAG 2.2 Card Deck brings together key elements from tools, articles, and documentation into a single structured format - designed to reduce cognitive load, support clarity, and make accessibility work more actionable.\\n\\nThis talk explores the decisions behind the card deck: how simplification can still be accurate (enough), how structure can drive better team behavior, and why even small design decisions should reflect how humans actually process information.\\n\\n**About Johannes:**\\nIn addition to his commitment to the Graz UX community, Johannes Lehner is the Regional Representative of UXPA Austria. Since 2024, he has been particularly committed to promoting accessibility and fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration between the UX community and other fields. At the same time, Johannes started his \"Design System Diaries\", a LinkedIn Live webinar series where he shares in-depth knowledge and practical insights on design systems.\\n\\nTogether with his office dog Zeus, Johannes works as a Lead UX Engineer at Intact GmbH. Since he started his position in 2014, he has played a key role in raising awareness of UX at Intact, resulting in a UX-conscious approach to projects. In addition to building Intact\\'s UX team, he initiated and led the implementation of ZEUS, Intact\\'s design system, establishing solid processes and fostering cross-functional and cross-departmental collaboration.\\n\\nAdditionally, Johannes takes on freelance projects under the jBear Graphics brand, supporting companies in UX research, concept creation, and integrating UX into their businesses for over ten years. Until 2023, he also shared his UX expertise as a guest lecturer at the University of Passau (Germany).\\n\\n--\\n**This time, we\\'re introducing a new format to make our UXPS sessions more interactive and collaborative.**\\n\\n* We\\'ll use a Miro board to collect questions.\\n* Everyone can also place inputs about topics that might interest others.\\n* Participants are encouraged to unmute themselves to speak out or ask questions during the talk.\\n* We\\'ll also have a dedicated Q&A session at the end for additional questions.\\n\\nWe believe this approach will enhance engagement and ensure we cover topics that are important to you. Looking forward to your active participation!\\n\\nCheers andâ¦ happy Thinking.',\n",

       "   'description': '**Join our free BLISS Speaker Series Summer 2025!**\\n\\nWe are excited to feature **Dr. Martin Genzel**, Senior Research Engineer at **Merantix Momentum**, who will discuss \"**Can Compressing Foundation Models be as Easy as Image Compression?**\", lasting approximately 45 minutes. After the talk, seize the opportunity to connect with fellow AI enthusiasts to share ideas and questions while enjoying free drinks. **Door close by 7.15pm, so please come early! Also, \"attend\"ing (RSVP) here on Meetup is strictly necessary to be guaranteed entry.**\\nPlease note that Meetup has recently been quite keen on promoting its Plus program. However, you are not obligated to purchase it, as both our events and the platform remain free.\\n\\n**Abstract**: The widespread adoption of Foundation Models, especially LLMs, is often hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, especially in resource-limited settings. While post-training compression offers a promising avenue to mitigate these challenges, the process can feel like a \"black box\" for the user, requiring significant expertise and trial-and-error to find the right balance between model size and performance. This talk introduces Any Compression via Iterative Pruning (ACIP), a novel algorithmic approach designed with the user in mind. ACIP allows for intuitive and direct control over the compression-performance trade-off, akin to compressing an image. It leverages a single gradient descent run of iterative pruning to establish a global parameter ranking, from which models of any target size can be immediately materialized. ACIP demonstrates strong predictive performance on downstream tasks without costly fine-tuning. Across various open-weight LLMs, it achieves state-of-the-art compression results compared to existing factorization-based methods. Moreover, it seamlessly complements common quantization techniques for even greater compression.\\n\\nWe are [BLISS](https://bliss.berlin/) e.V., the **AI** **organization** in Berlin that **connects like-minded individuals** who share great interest and passion for the field of machine learning. This summer 2025, we will host an exciting speaker series on site in Berlin, featuring excellent researchers from Merantix Momentum, Meta AI, Inria, Microsoft AI4Science, Google DeepMind, and University of Oxford.\\nWebsite: [https://bliss.berlin](https://bliss.berlin/)\\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@bliss.ev.berlin\\n\\nDisclaimer: By attending this event you agree to be photographed.',\n",

By meeting with the artists from that era, they saw firsthand how independent creators built movements but often struggled financially - a struggle that persists today.

Jaguar Identification Project**\\n***Project by Davide Panza and Shahabeddin Dayani***\\n\\nThis project aims to develop an intelligent system using computer vision to identify individual jaguars by their unique facial and body patterns. A Vision Transformer (ViT) and advanced self-attention models will be used for segmentation and classification, with fine-tuned embeddings to enhance accuracy. The system will aid zoologists in tracking jaguars, especially after natural disasters, and will be deployed as an API for practical use.\\n\\n**2\\\\. AI\\\\-Powered Sustainability Assistant for EPD\\\\-Based Product Design**\\n***Project by Murilo Polla***\\n\\nAn AI-powered assistant that helps companies design sustainable products by leveraging Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for informed decision-making. The aim of the project is to simplify sustainability analysis and optimize product design for lower environmental impact.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Speech\\\\-based screening of cognitive impairment in Spanish\\\\-speaking populations\\\\.**\\n***Project by Jose Alfonso Hernandez Ramirez***\\n\\nThis project focuses on developing a speech-based screening tool for Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using machine learning models trained on audio recordings from Spanish-speaking individuals. The goal is to create a non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily deployable diagnostic tool for early cognitive impairment detection.\\n\\n**4\\\\. PUT ME TO SLEEP\\\\! IF YOU CAN\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.**\\n**a Machine Learning Approach to Sleep-Inducing Sound Patterns**\\n***Project by Dr. Khashayar Razghandi***\\n\\nThis project aims to apply a data science approach to analyze a wide variety of sleep-aid audio content and user engagement metrics from YouTube / Soundcloud, in order to explore this unique soundscape and identify the patterns most strongly associated with effective sleep induction.\\nThe trained model can be embedded in an application (sleep-aid or sleep-tracker) to evaluate the Sleep-aid Score of an audio content or recommend effective potential tracks âeven beyond this sound scopeâ may it be a rainy night, a western classical or a Python lecture.\\n\\n**5\\\\. A Diagnostic Tool for Identifying Malignant Skin Lesions Across All Skin Tones**\\n***Project by Matthias Schultze-Kraft***\\n\\nAI-based diagnostic tools for skin cancer have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and low cost. However, a critical limitation of many existing models is their lack of diversity in training dataâparticularly the underrepresentation of darker skin tones. As a result, these models tend to perform poorly on non-white patients, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and contributing to significant health disparities.\\nThis project aims to address this issue by developing a diagnostic tool capable of accurately identifying malignant skin lesions across all skin tones\\n\\n**6\\\\. Predicting antiviral properties of small molecules with GNNs**\\n***Project by Slav Semerdzhiev***\\n\\nThis project leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the antiviral potency of small molecules by analyzing their molecular structures and interactions. By learning complex patterns in chemical data, GNNs can identify promising drug candidates with high efficacy against viruses. The insights gained from this approach aim to accelerate antiviral drug discovery and development.\\n\\n**7\\\\. Deep Reinforcement Learning for Assortment Modeling \\\\+ Deep Learning for Customer Classification and Choice Modeling**\\n***Project by Mureji Fatunde***\\n\\nOn digital platforms (or in physical settings) where customers arrive repeatedly, platforms must decide which options to offer them, as this influences their subsequent choices as well as the outcomes for both user and platform.\\nThis project will 1) classify customers on a digital platform based on their latent motivation (think: whether they're here to learn vs earn, or which out of several options is the primary emotion driving them) using deep mixture models, 2) predict consumer actions by using deep learning to estimate parameters of the consumer choice model, and 3) use reinforcement learning to select customer offerings/recommendations in order to optimize a long-term outcome.\\n\\n**8.EasyLens â Smart AI Assistant for Everyday Tasks in Germany**\\n***Project by Osama Abuhussein***\\n\\nEasyLens is an iOS app that uses AI and computer vision to simplify daily tasks like waste sorting, understanding German documents, and identifying tourist spots. Users simply point their camera and select a feature; the app does the rest using Core ML and OCR.\\n\\n**20:00** \\\\- Open for networking\\n\\n**20:30** \\\\- Wrap up\\n\\nWe have limited seat so please RSVP soon.

Er teilt mit uns seine Erfahrungen mit innovativen Teamkonzepten.\\n\\n**Was erwartet Euch?**\\n\"Radikaler WertschÃ¶pfungsfokus mit fluiden Teams\"\\n\\nDie klassischen statischen (agilen) Teams sind ein riesiger Fortschritt gegenÃ¼ber funktionalen Silos. Aber auch sie sind nicht ohne Probleme und kÃ¶nnen zu Silos 2.0 werden.\\n\\nZum GlÃ¼ck gibt es inzwischen viele Jahre Erfahrungen mit alternativen fluiden TeamansÃ¤tzen wie Mobile Teams, Mission Teams und Floating Teams. Diese fokussieren die WertschÃ¶pfung stÃ¤rker und vereinfachen dadurch die team-Ã¼bergreifende Planung und Koordination drastisch. Neben den positiven Erfahrungen mit diesen AnsÃ¤tzen thematisiert der Vortrag auch die Voraussetzungen und Risiken, die mit den alternativen AnsÃ¤tzen einhergehen.\\n\\nStefan Roock:\\nBio\\n\\n\"Wir mÃ¼ssen immer wieder das UnmÃ¶gliche versuchen, um das MÃ¶gliche zu erreichen.\" H. Hesse\\n\\nStefan Roock (it-agile) will eine bessere Arbeitswelt schaffen; eine in der Kunden von den Produkten und Services begeistert sind, Mitarbeitende ihre Arbeitsbedingungen lieben und die Unternehmen erfolgreich sind. Er hilft Menschen und Unternehmen dabei, ihre Potenziale fÃ¼r dieses Ideal zu entfesseln.\\n\\nStefan Roock hat seit 1999 neue Arbeits- und OrganisationsansÃ¤tze in Deutschland maÃgeblich mit verbreitet und weiterentwickelt (agil, Scrum, Kanban etc.). ZunÃ¤chst hat er als Entwickler in agilen Teams, spÃ¤ter als Scrum Master/Agile Coach und Product Owner gearbeitet. Er hat seitdem sein VerstÃ¤ndnis dessen, was fÃ¼r begeisternde Produkte und Arbeitsbedingungen notwendig ist, kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt. Besondere Produkte entstehen nicht dadurch, dass Teams \"agil\" Anforderungen umsetzen. Stattdessen mÃ¼ssen Teams gemeinsam im direkten Kundenkontakt Produkte und Services gestalten.\\n\\nStefan Roock ist regelmÃ¤Ãiger Sprecher auf Konferenzen, bei User Groups und in Unternehmen.

Explore innovative projects, connect with like-minded professionals, and enjoy networking over pizza and drinks.\\n\\n**Agenda:**\\n**17:30** \\\\- Drinks and Networking\\n\\n**18:00** \\\\- Welcome & Introduction\\n\\nFollowed by Project Presentations\\n\\n**Project Ideas:**\\n\\n**1\\\\. Jaguar Identification Project**\\n***Project by Davide Panza and Shahabeddin Dayani***\\n\\nThis project aims to develop an intelligent system using computer vision to identify individual jaguars by their unique facial and body patterns. A Vision Transformer (ViT) and advanced self-attention models will be used for segmentation and classification, with fine-tuned embeddings to enhance accuracy. The system will aid zoologists in tracking jaguars, especially after natural disasters, and will be deployed as an API for practical use.\\n\\n**2\\\\. AI\\\\-Powered Sustainability Assistant for EPD\\\\-Based Product Design**\\n***Project by Murilo Polla***\\n\\nAn AI-powered assistant that helps companies design sustainable products by leveraging Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for informed decision-making. The aim of the project is to simplify sustainability analysis and optimize product design for lower environmental impact.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Speech\\\\-based screening of cognitive impairment in Spanish\\\\-speaking populations\\\\.**\\n***Project by Jose Alfonso Hernandez Ramirez***\\n\\nThis project focuses on developing a speech-based screening tool for Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using machine learning models trained on audio recordings from Spanish-speaking individuals. The goal is to create a non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily deployable diagnostic tool for early cognitive impairment detection.\\n\\n**4\\\\. PUT ME TO SLEEP\\\\! IF YOU CAN\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.**\\n**a Machine Learning Approach to Sleep-Inducing Sound Patterns**\\n***Project by Dr. Khashayar Razghandi***\\n\\nThis project aims to apply a data science approach to analyze a wide variety of sleep-aid audio content and user engagement metrics from YouTube / Soundcloud, in order to explore this unique soundscape and identify the patterns most strongly associated with effective sleep induction.\\nThe trained model can be embedded in an application (sleep-aid or sleep-tracker) to evaluate the Sleep-aid Score of an audio content or recommend effective potential tracks âeven beyond this sound scopeâ may it be a rainy night, a western classical or a Python lecture.\\n\\n**5\\\\. A Diagnostic Tool for Identifying Malignant Skin Lesions Across All Skin Tones**\\n***Project by Matthias Schultze-Kraft***\\n\\nAI-based diagnostic tools for skin cancer have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and low cost. However, a critical limitation of many existing models is their lack of diversity in training dataâparticularly the underrepresentation of darker skin tones. As a result, these models tend to perform poorly on non-white patients, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and contributing to significant health disparities.\\nThis project aims to address this issue by developing a diagnostic tool capable of accurately identifying malignant skin lesions across all skin tones\\n\\n**6\\\\. Predicting antiviral properties of small molecules with GNNs**\\n***Project by Slav Semerdzhiev***\\n\\nThis project leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the antiviral potency of small molecules by analyzing their molecular structures and interactions. By learning complex patterns in chemical data, GNNs can identify promising drug candidates with high efficacy against viruses. The insights gained from this approach aim to accelerate antiviral drug discovery and development.\\n\\n**7\\\\. Deep Reinforcement Learning for Assortment Modeling \\\\+ Deep Learning for Customer Classification and Choice Modeling**\\n***Project by Mureji Fatunde***\\n\\nOn digital platforms (or in physical settings) where customers arrive repeatedly, platforms must decide which options to offer them, as this influences their subsequent choices as well as the outcomes for both user and platform.\\nThis project will 1) classify customers on a digital platform based on their latent motivation (think: whether they're here to learn vs earn, or which out of several options is the primary emotion driving them) using deep mixture models, 2) predict consumer actions by using deep learning to estimate parameters of the consumer choice model, and 3) use reinforcement learning to select customer offerings/recommendations in order to optimize a long-term outcome.\\n\\n**8.EasyLens â Smart AI Assistant for Everyday Tasks in Germany**\\n***Project by Osama Abuhussein***\\n\\nEasyLens is an iOS app that uses AI and computer vision to simplify daily tasks like waste sorting, understanding German documents, and identifying tourist spots. Users simply point their camera and select a feature; the app does the rest using Core ML and OCR.\\n\\n**20:00** \\\\- Open for networking\\n\\n**20:30** \\\\- Wrap up\\n\\nWe have limited seat so please RSVP soon.

Meeting random people over and over and never see the same person again! In order to find \"Real Long Term Friendship\" in Berlin, do as follows:\\n\\n* You should not care how many people are joining this meetup.\\nYou RVSP. Even if only one person is joining. Because if everyone are waiting for everyone else to RVSP, nobody joins and nobody finds a new friend.\\n* You do not care how many people of the opposite sex are joining.\\nYou are looking for friends. Finding the best romantic partner in the world, while avoiding not very attractive others, can be your other goal, for another time. Here we are looking for Friends. Real ones.\\n* You are going to risk a very precious property of yours: Your time!\\nYes, there are thousands of opportunities in Berlin, there might be a rock concert for free, a birthday party you might miss, an important person might call you and invite you spontaneously, but you never find new friends until you decide to risk your time and meet people anyway. \"I will check my calendar and get back to you\" also does not work. Commit your time and spend it. Trust me, you won\\'t go bankrupt ;-)\\n* You are ready to use your phone as a real phone!\\nYou might have been using your phone as a tablet to visit Instagram and Facebook and watch movies. But if you want to find friends, you must know that people might take your phone number and give you theirs. That means they will Call you! And you have to pick up the phone and answer it. If you want to find new friends, you must be ready to do something really hard for the first time after years: Call people first, and if they called you: Answer your phone!\\n* You are going to meet some people twice!\\nThat\\'s the point of friendship.

       "   'description': 'Good day, good fellow agilists!\\n\\nDo you remember our Manifesto for Agile Software Development? And in particular, the following principle: \"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation\"?\\n\\nAnd when was the last time you did it with another agilist? And not from your company!\\n\\nYes, I know, the fucking covid hit us hard. But don\\'t you think it\\'s time to meet and have these face-to-face conversations?\\n\\nI don\\'t know a lot of agilists in Berlin, but I believe there are many of us! And maybe we feel lonely and lost on our Agile path.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t want this to be yet another formal professional meetup - my dream is to have a safe space where we will meet and talk and network.\\nSo let\\'s meet! And let\\'s do it informally! And let\\'s share some drinks, stories, feelings, and emotions!\\n\\nLet\\'s build together the Berlin Agile Tribe!\\n\\n**What is intervision**\\n\\nWe\\'ll split the table into two parts:\\n1 - as usual, it\\'s going to be an informal professional chit-chat around Agile\\n2 - we\\'re going to run a so-called Group Intervision.\\nâIntervisionâ is a form of group supervision. The term intervision is related to supervision but distinct from it. Rather than seeing others and their work from above (super = above or beyond), the perspective taken in intervision is from within (inter = between, among, in the midst of, mutually, reciprocally or together).\\n\\nAs the term suggests, intervision is a peer-led method that does not rely on an (external) expert acting as facilitator. The various roles are undertaken by all participants who will ideally swap roles from session to session. Therefore, intervision is defined by its group mode, a process with specified roles, the reciprocity and reversibility of all roles and the focus on professional practice situations or challenges.\\n\\nThe method is designed for peer-led reflective groups and practice supervisors who could support teams to use this method. If you would like to help create and offer a safe, reflective space for your team, or across teams, then this method would be useful.',\n",

Another reason for this meetup is to meet people with whom you might potentially get along really well based on your type. This can lead to meaningful connections :)\\u2029Although the meetup is geared towards people who are interested in learning about MBTI theory and using it to improve their lives, our conversations arenât only about that!

If you have dozens of games already under your belt, and are looking for other fun people to explore the depths of strategy and complexity that Clocktower has to offer, you\\'ll be very welcome at this event!\\n\\nOur group aims to provide a fun and welcoming space to experience this thrilling game of social deception. We focus on promoting a positive group atmosphere, where players donât take themselves or the game too seriously, whether theyâre heroically winning or spectacularly losing. Our players follow the code of conduct for the Berlin Board Gamers group and are expected to treat each other with respect and consideration â âkilling with grace, and dying with dignityâ.\\n\\nWe normally only have resources for one game at a time. If you are marked as \"attending\" in Meetup and are in your seat at 19:00, your place is guaranteed. All other seats are first come, first served. On Tuesdays we normally run two consecutive games of custom scripts.\\n\\nWe play in English so players should be able to understand and express themselves in English: an exception is possible for one pair of players willing to play together (as a âRevolutionaryâ pair) where one player can interpret into and out of English. Please let us know in advance if this is the case.',\n",

Books/happiness shared are books/happiness multiplied!\\n\\nThis is a great way to give books a new home and make room for new books: that book you feel guilty for not having read even though it\\'s been sitting on your bedside table for the last 5 years, the book you liked but didn\\'t love, the book you loved so much you want everyone to read it, the book you somehow own three copies of, that book you absolutely hated even though everyone else loves it, etc., etc., etc....\\n\\nAnd chances are high you\\'ll go home with an alluring stranger you never would have thought of reading before (OR that book you\\'ve been lusting after for years but never enough to actually buy!).\\n\\nGROUP EXPECTATIONS for PLEASANT SWAPPING\\n\\nâ¢ Please bring a book!\\n\\nSome people bring more than one, and the organizers usually have a handful, but if everybody ends up not bringing a book, we have nothing to swap, except stories. But we won\\'t chase you away if you\\'re empty handed.\\n\\nâ¢ Books stay on the table, open for sharing, until you are ready to leave so everyone can have a fair look\\n\\nSee a book you like? Please put your name down as a candidate to take it home (we provide sticky notes!), and wait to see if anybody else is interested before snapping it up, as in, please wait until you are leaving. One of the key aspects of the swap is getting exposed to books outside of our library bubble, so it\\'s important to keep the books as open to sharing as possible.\\n\\nIf two or more people want the only copy of a book, talk it over. Maybe you can swap contact info to share the book one after the other. Or maybe it turns out one of you isn\\'t that interested, or has found another book instead. Or one of you REALLY wants to read it. The best part: now you have found somebody whose taste you can really admire.\\n\\nWhen you leave, please let the group know which book you are taking.\\n\\nWe consider it poor form to walk away with a book with several names on it without letting the others know.\\n\\nAlso, don\\'t be shy! Don\\'t shy away from a book because there\\'s already a name on it, and feel free to put your name on as many books as you want. We\\'re more generous than just bring-one-take-one.\\n\\nâ¢ Book Swap is 10 times better than a Book Club because you can talk about ALL the books instead of just one!\\n\\nHalf the fun of Book Swap is swapping recommendations for reads that aren\\'t even on the table. The other half is meeting other great readers. Another half is taking home that new book!\\n\\nâ¢ NO POLITICS. (please.)\\n\\nUnless you\\'re talking about a book.\\n\\nIt\\'s Friday night. Let\\'s leave current events at the office for once, please.\\n\\nPlease respect this space as first and foremost a community for connecting readers over their love of books and reading, stories, and narratives of all sorts. Please be respectful of tastes and opinions.\\n\\nIf something is bothering you, please reach out to the organisers, and we\\'ll do our best to solve it.\\n\\nâ¢ Don\\'t expect your book back: if you love it, let it go\\n\\nIn spirit, this is an opportunity to share=lend books among peers. In practice, this is more of a book-giveaway. It is NEVER guaranteed you will get your book back, even with your name and email inside the book with a \"Please Return.\" If you\\'re really serious, it\\'s best to get the borrower\\'s contact info and prod them for it. Note: our staunch \"Regulars\" are significantly more likely to come back with the book if you ask them (and you have to come back too!). On the other hand, some books keep coming back like bad pennies.\\n\\nâ¢ PLEASE PAY FOR YOUR ORDER and tip your server.\\n\\nTo every book its reader, and to every reader their book.\\n\\nâ¢ Major LANGUAGES (and genres) of this meetup\\n\\nEnglish, German, French, Spanish; Fiction, Non-Fiction, Serious Reading, Light Fun, Everything!\\n\\nOn average I think it\\'s 60% English, 40% German, and 10% French/Spanish; usually 80% fiction, but the mix is different every time. One of the best compliments the group has received is the consistently high quality of reading material on the table. We have \"classics,\" we have celebrity book club books, Krimis, Booker winners, and everything in between. You never know who can read what languages, and there\\'s no accounting for taste.\\n\\nWe are a delightful and international group of readers.\\n\\nWe look forward to swapping with you!',\n",

       "   'description': 'In one of the main treaties of Vedanta, Yama, the Lord of Death, reveals to a little boy the truth about the ultimate reality that goes beyond death. Spiritual traditions naturally have a strong relation with death â leading even to practices that are meant to prepare on for a âliberating deathâ as an opportunity for spiritual progress. At the same time, society and technology seem to bring forward ever new strategies and ideas to postpone or even avoid death.\\n\\n**Letâs take an afternoon to share about death and how it relates to our spiritual journey.**\\n\\nâ*When effort is needed, effort will appear. When effortless-ness becomes essential, it will assert itself. You need not push life about. Just flow with it and give yourself completely to the task of the present moment, which is the dying now to the now. For living is dying.

       "   'description': '*In collaboration with* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com), *[Qase](https://qase.io) is presenting the **sixth** Meetup on Quality Engineering in Berlin.*\\n\\n*This time, weâre bringing you three deep-dive talks and one interactive workshop â all designed to challenge the way you think about quality, testing, and collaboration.*\\n\\n*As always, expect great conversations, snacks, and drinks. See you there!*\\n\\n**AGENDA**\\n\\n**1\\\\. Alexander Ptakhin\\\\, Tech Lead at Prestatech: *People vs Processes: How to Survive, Influence, and Improve Quality***\\nDo you feel frustrated when you put in a lot of effort to complete a task, only for no one to be happy with the result? The tester says it\\'s wrong, and the product manager insists it should be supported. \"Whatâs wrong with me?\" Nothing â the challenge isn\\'t just individual effort, but how development and QA work together. Developers and testers can influence these processes, not just managers. We just need to know what options we have.\\nAlex will share communication strategies from his experience working with DevOps, QA, and developers, navigating informational chaos, and introducing new ideas.\\n\\n**2\\\\. Anupam Krishnamurthy\\\\, SDET / Quality Coach at bitgrip: *Shift-Left. Move Forward***\\nWhat does the term \"release day\" bring to mind? A bundle of stress? Testing work piling up like a balloon and exploding? Engineers trying to sneak features in *after* you\\'ve finished testing?\\nDoes your job feel like a crescendo of pain that culminates in a release, only to start all over over again? Should your job location say \"release hell\" and your job description \"firefighter\"? You are not alone! This is an entrenched problem in quality processes everywhere, beyond just software engineering. And yes, there are solutions. One of them goes by the cryptic name \"Shift-Left\".\\nShift-Left is often miscommunicated. In this talk, Anupam rescues this term from management jargon and SEO buzzwords to unpack what it means for you as a quality professional. And here\\'s the spoiler â Shift-Left is the key to upgrade your career and get paid better.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Taras Koschmann\\\\, Test Engineer at Siemens: *Beyond Software: Testing the Systems That Move the World***\\nSoftware testing isnât just about apps and web services â itâs also about ensuring the safety of real-world systems. Taras, a test engineer at Siemens, takes us inside the high-stakes world of railway system testing, where software meets physics, mechanics, and strict regulatory standards. Weâll explore how modern rail networks operate, the complex interplay of automation and control systems, and why testing in this domain is more than just debuggingâitâs about preventing real-world failures. Expect an interactive deep dive into how railway traffic is managed, the challenges of certifying high-risk systems, and the technical depth required to keep trains running safely and efficiently.\\n\\n**4\\\\. Veronika Ilina\\\\, Consultant: *The QA Negotiations Quest: Survive Your Leaderâs Mood Swings***\\n\\nEver wondered how to pitch your ideas successfully â even when your team lead seems determined to say âNoâ? In this interactive, hilarious, and highly practical QA negotiation **workshop**, youâll team up to face an unpredictable team lead whose reactions are randomized and range from âyour arguments are just badâ to suspiciously supportive. Sharpen your negotiation skills by pitching salary raises, fresh tech tools, or smarter processes â and learn to confidently navigate even the trickiest leadership styles. Will your idea survive the roll of the dice? Letâs find out together!',\n",

       "   'description': \"**Please make sure to read the following before RSVPing.**\\n\\n**Hello, Berlin!**\\nWe're Mindful Mingle, a cozy corner in our bustling city dedicated to heartfelt conversations and genuine emotional support. A place where you're not just another face in the crowd, but a valued member of a caring community. In a city where the conversation about mental health is often shrouded in silence, Mindful Mingle welcomes openness and emotional honesty.\\n\\n**A Bit About Me and Why This Group**\\nI'm not an organization or a seasoned event planner â just someone who believes in the power of sharing and listening. Sure, I have my doubts (who doesn't?), but I'm taking the leap anyway. If you, like me, have been searching for a space where you can be real about how you're doing... really doing, then this might just be for you.\\n\\n**Meeting Structure:**\\n\\n1. **Introductions**\\n2. **The Check-In**\\n3. **Empathy Game**\\n4. **Mingle & Muse**\\n\\n**1.** In the introduction phase, we settle in the cafÃ©, get comfortable, and wait for everyone to arrive. It is important to arrive on time for this phase or let us know if you are delayed. If you cannot attend, please update your RSVP as soon as possible.\\n\\n**2.** In the check-in phase, you can share with the group how you have been doing in recent weeks. The level of depth you choose to share is up to you. Since the goal is for everyone to have a chance to participate and to create a safe, accepting environment without judgment, follow-up questions or comments are not encouraged.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Empathy Game: Playfully connect on a deeper level**\\nEmpathy fuels connection, but what does real connection look like in the digital age? When do we truly listen and engage with each otherâs stories?\\nThe game is simple: pick a card, share a story, and let listeners respond by rolling a dice to explore their own experiences.\\nThe Empathy Game fosters sharing, listening, and vulnerability.\\n\\n**4.** In the Mingle and Muse phase, the group will no longer be moderated by the host. You are free to mingle with anyoneâwhether to follow up on a previous topic, ask a question, share your thoughts, or connect over a shared experience. To avoid forgetting ideas that came to you earlier in the session, having a pen and paper handy could be useful.\\n\\n**Who is this meetup for?\\\\***\\n\\n* You have experience with therapy.\\n* You are mindful of other people's vulnerability.\\n* You can articulate and explain your thoughts and feelings.\\n* You have a genuine interest in this topic.\\n* Not everything seems fabulous and awesome in your life right now.\\n* You didnât join just because you couldnât find something else to do.\\n* You would feel responsible and commited that you RSVPed (e.g., by putting it in your calendar).\\n* Preferably, you live in Berlin or nearby.\\n\\n**Important note on RSVP:\\\\***\\nThe reason behind my emphasis on updating RSVPs is that the idea is for us all to sit in a circle so everyone can be heard. When the RSVP is not updated we expect more number of poeple, and it can cause stress as I try to figure out how and where to fit everyone. We would also wait to start until everyone who is coming has arrived so that they can be involved from the beginningâunderstanding the structure, knowing who is present, hearing the introduction, and feeling welcomed.\\n\\nBesides that, irresponsible RSVPs might prevent others from joining who could have attended and needed a setting like this. It can also make people with social anxiety feel more anxious when seeing a high number of attendees, which doesn't reflect the actual attendance rate.\\n\\nI hope you can imagine and relate to what happens behind the scenes, and update your RSVP if needed. :)\\n\\n**If you're anxious about joining, feel free to contact me personally.\\\\***\\nIf you'd like to attend but aren't sure about feeling comfortable, it might help to mention that you're reaching out for this reason. Then we can find a way for you to join without feeling awkward or uncomfortable. :)\",\n",

Dieser meditative Zustand kann spÃ¼rbar wahrgenommen werden. Es geschieht sehr spontan und ohne Anstrengung. Es sind keine Matten oder spezielle Kleidung notwendig.\\n\\nEs handelt sich um eine spezielle Art des Yoga (das bedeutet in der indischen Sprache Sanskrit âVerbindungâ). Durch diese Meditation wird eine in uns schlafende Kraft erweckt. Sie hilft uns, zu entspannen, uns gut zu fÃ¼hlen und gibt uns emotionale Ausgeglichenheit, Zufriedenheit und Freude. Man kommt in die Mitte: sehr aktive Menschen werden ruhiger - lethargische Menschen erhalten neue Kraft und Dynamik.\\n\\nDass dies auch die Gesundheit verbessern kann, zeigen sogar wissenschaftliche Studien. Die Wechselwirkung zwischen Geist und KÃ¶rper wird immer mehr erforscht. Zum Beispiel wurden positive Effekte dieser Meditation bei Burnout, Depression, Schlaflosigkeit, ADHS, Asthma und bei vielen anderen Problemen festgestellt. Ãngste werden reduziert, die Konzentration gesteigert und die Lebensfreude erhÃ¶ht.\\n\\nWir freuen uns diese Erfahrung mit euch zu teilen.\\n\\nDie Kursleiter sind alle ehrenamtlich fÃ¼r den gemeinnÃ¼tzigen Verein Sahaja Yoga e.V. tÃ¤tig und haben mehrere Jahre Erfahrung in Sahaja Yoga Meditationskursen.\\n\\nDie Kurse finden in der Regel in deutscher Sprache statt. Spontanes Kommen ist mÃ¶glich, fÃ¼r uns wÃ¤re es zum planen gut, wenn ihr hier euer Kommen anmelden wÃ¼rdet.\\n\\n****\\n\\nIm ersten Satz der UNESCO-Verfassung steht: âDa Kriege im Geist der Menschen entstehen, muss auch der Frieden im Geist der Menschen verankert werden.â Deshalb ist Sahaja Yoga ein Partner des UNESCO Center for Peace.\\n\\nDie Teilnahme an den Kursen ist kostenfrei. Spenden fÃ¼r die Raummiete sind willkommen.',\n",

Er teilt mit uns seine Erfahrungen mit innovativen Teamkonzepten.\\n\\n**Was erwartet Euch?**\\n\"Radikaler WertschÃ¶pfungsfokus mit fluiden Teams\"\\n\\nDie klassischen statischen (agilen) Teams sind ein riesiger Fortschritt gegenÃ¼ber funktionalen Silos. Aber auch sie sind nicht ohne Probleme und kÃ¶nnen zu Silos 2.0 werden.\\n\\nZum GlÃ¼ck gibt es inzwischen viele Jahre Erfahrungen mit alternativen fluiden TeamansÃ¤tzen wie Mobile Teams, Mission Teams und Floating Teams. Diese fokussieren die WertschÃ¶pfung stÃ¤rker und vereinfachen dadurch die team-Ã¼bergreifende Planung und Koordination drastisch. Neben den positiven Erfahrungen mit diesen AnsÃ¤tzen thematisiert der Vortrag auch die Voraussetzungen und Risiken, die mit den alternativen AnsÃ¤tzen einhergehen.\\n\\nStefan Roock:\\nBio\\n\\n\"Wir mÃ¼ssen immer wieder das UnmÃ¶gliche versuchen, um das MÃ¶gliche zu erreichen.\" H. Hesse\\n\\nStefan Roock (it-agile) will eine bessere Arbeitswelt schaffen; eine in der Kunden von den Produkten und Services begeistert sind, Mitarbeitende ihre Arbeitsbedingungen lieben und die Unternehmen erfolgreich sind. Er hilft Menschen und Unternehmen dabei, ihre Potenziale fÃ¼r dieses Ideal zu entfesseln.\\n\\nStefan Roock hat seit 1999 neue Arbeits- und OrganisationsansÃ¤tze in Deutschland maÃgeblich mit verbreitet und weiterentwickelt (agil, Scrum, Kanban etc.). ZunÃ¤chst hat er als Entwickler in agilen Teams, spÃ¤ter als Scrum Master/Agile Coach und Product Owner gearbeitet. Er hat seitdem sein VerstÃ¤ndnis dessen, was fÃ¼r begeisternde Produkte und Arbeitsbedingungen notwendig ist, kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt. Besondere Produkte entstehen nicht dadurch, dass Teams \"agil\" Anforderungen umsetzen. Stattdessen mÃ¼ssen Teams gemeinsam im direkten Kundenkontakt Produkte und Services gestalten.\\n\\nStefan Roock ist regelmÃ¤Ãiger Sprecher auf Konferenzen, bei User Groups und in Unternehmen.

       "   'description': 'Es gibt ein Input, danach ist die freie Diskussion erÃ¶ffnet.\\nDas Impulsreferat kommt diesmal von Susanne.\\nDie Veranstaltung lÃ¤uft auf Spendenbasis.\\n\\nEs geht das nÃ¤chste Mal um eine Theorie von Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek, der ein **Ereignis** als einen radikalen Bruch mit der bestehenden Ordnung beschreibt, der nicht einfach aus vorhersehbaren Ursachen resultiert, sondern eine neue RealitÃ¤t schafft. Es ist ein Moment, in dem das UnmÃ¶gliche plÃ¶tzlich mÃ¶glich wird und die symbolische Ordnung neu strukturiert wird. Ein Ereignis ist nicht nur eine Ã¤uÃere VerÃ¤nderung, sondern transformiert auch die Art und Weise, wie wir die Welt wahrnehmen und interpretieren. Es ist oft mit einer subjektiven Entscheidung oder einer revolutionÃ¤ren Handlung verbunden, die die bestehenden Normen und Strukturen infrage stellt.\\nIn seinem Buch **\"Was ist ein Ereignis?\"** vertieft Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek seine Theorie des Ereignisses, indem er sich auf eine Reihe von Philosophen und Denktraditionen bezieht. Hier sind die zentralen Aspekte und Bezugspunkte: Å½iÅ¾ek Ã¼bernimmt von Alain Badiou die Idee, dass ein Ereignis ein radikaler Bruch mit der bestehenden Ordnung ist, der eine neue Wahrheit oder MÃ¶glichkeit erÃ¶ffnet, von Marx die Idee, dass ein Ereignis oft mit einer revolutionÃ¤ren VerÃ¤nderung einhergeht.\\nAus der Psychoanalyse Lacans Ã¼bernimmt Å½iÅ¾ek die Idee, dass ein Ereignis die symbolische Ordnung durchbricht und das Reale (das Unfassbare, Unsymbolisierbare) berÃ¼hrt. Å½iÅ¾ek zieht Parallelen zur christlichen Theologie, insbesondere zur Idee der Auferstehung als einem Ereignis, das die bestehende Ordnung umstÃ¼rzt und eine neue SchÃ¶pfung ermÃ¶glicht.\\nÅ½iÅ¾eks Beispiele stammen aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Politik, Geschichte, Kunst und Religion. Hier sind einige zentrale Beispiele: Er nennt die FranzÃ¶sische Revolution, die Oktoberrevolution, den Fall der Berliner Mauer (1989), die Entstehung der Moderne, 9/11 (2001), und die Auferstehung Christi. Die Auferstehung hat die symbolische Ordnung radikal verÃ¤ndert. Das UnmÃ¶gliche (die Ãberwindung des Todes) wurde wahr wird und schuf eine neue spirituelle und moralische RealitÃ¤t.',\n",

If you want to find new friends, you must be ready to do something really hard for the first time after years: Call people first, and if they called you: Answer your phone!\\n* You are going to meet some people twice!\\nThat\\'s the point of friendship. We already can experience random encounters with random people in random places one at a time. But that is not called friendship. If you want friends, you must be ready to meet the same person more than once.\\n\\nIf you agree with above, RVSP and COME!

Vorher erlebte sie frustrierende Verluste beim Aktienhandel, ohne eine klare Strategie. Begeistert von der Einfachheit und ZugÃ¤nglichkeit von Raiks Methode hat sie diese Meetup-Gruppe ins Leben gerufen und engagiert sich dafÃ¼r, Menschen zu motivieren und zu unterstÃ¼tzen, die sich in einer Ã¤hnlichen Situation wie sie selbst zuvor befanden.

       "   'description': '**Um was geht es dieses mal?**\\nDieses Mal haben wir direkt zwei Talks fÃ¼r euch im GepÃ¤ck!\\n\\n**In the Circle: Meine persÃ¶nliche Reise in die Welt des Mob-Programmings - Michael KnÃ¼ppel**\\n\"Was wÃ¤re, wenn ich euch erzÃ¤hle, dass es Teams gibt, die mit Mob Programming zusammen coden und produktiv arbeiten, und zwar in seiner extremen Form. Den... ganzen... Tag...\\nStellt euch vor: Gemeinsam coden, Pausen machen, Nachrichten an Stakeholder verfassen und andere typischerweise individuelle Aufgaben â alles in einem Team. Im Arbeitskontext versteht sich :)\\nIn diesem Talk mÃ¶chte ich meine persÃ¶nlichen Erfahrungen mit Mob Programming teilen. Dabei betone ich weniger, wie das Modell funktioniert, sondern vielmehr, was ich dabei gelernt habe. Ich erzÃ¤hle von Herausforderungen, den Aha-Momenten und wie Mob Programming sowohl unsere technische Expertise als auch unser TeamgefÃ¼hl gestÃ¤rkt hat.\"\\n\\n**Das Frontend im Backend: Webanwendungen mit Next.js - Nils Hartmann**\\n\"In meinem Vortrag mÃ¶chte ich mit euch in die Webentwicklung mit Next.js eintauchen. Dieses JavaScript-Framework verwischt die Grenzen zwischen reinen Backend- und Frontend-Anwendungen: Genau wie wie bei âklassischenâ Webanwendungen (mit Java, .NET etc) werden damit Multi-Page-Anwendungen gebaut, deren AusfÃ¼hrung und Rendering im Backend erfolgt. Dank der Integration von React kÃ¶nnen wir gleichzeitig aber nahtlos Logik implementieren, die im Browser ausgefÃ¼hrt und dort fÃ¼r flÃ¼ssige Interaktionen sorgt. Haben wir mit Next.js also das Beste aus beiden Welten? FÃ¼r welche AnwendungsfÃ¤lle lohnt sich Next.js und wo liegen dessen Grenzen? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, mÃ¶chte ich euch Next.js anhand von praktischen Beispielen mit Live Coding vorstellen. So sehen wir Entwicklung und Verhalten von Next.js-Anwendungen âlive und in Farbeâ, und haben Raum fÃ¼r Fragen und Diskussionen.\\nDer Vortrag richtet sich an Architekt:innen und Entwickler:innen von Web-Anwendungen und ausdrÃ¼cklich auch an Leute, die im Alltag eher im Backend als im Frontend unterwegs sind, aber ein VerstÃ¤ndnis aktueller Frontend-Technologien bekommen mÃ¶chten. Die gezeigten Code-Beispiele in React und Next.js werdet ihr auch ohne jeweilige Vorkenntnisse verstehen.\"\\n\\n**Hybrides Setup!**\\nWir freuen uns, euch bei uns in den RÃ¤umen der codecentric AG in Dortmund willkommen zu heiÃen. Vor Ort versorgen wir euch mit Snacks und GetrÃ¤nken und freuen uns gleichzeitig Ã¼ber interessante Diskussionen und einen guten Austausch. FÃ¼r alle, die es nicht zu uns ins Office schaffen, werden wir das Meetup Hybrid durchfÃ¼hren. Der Stream beginnt ca. 10 Minuten spÃ¤ter, damit wir vor Ort ausreichend MÃ¶glichkeit fÃ¼r persÃ¶nliches Kennenlernen haben.\\nDen Live-Stream findet ihr auf dem [YouTube-Channel der codecentric AG.](https://www.youtube.com/@codecentricAG)\\n\\n**Anreise:**\\nPer Zug: Vom Dortmunder HBF sind es ca. 10 Minuten zu FuÃ.\\nMit dem Auto: Vor dem Office finden sich einige ParkplÃ¤tze, am Wall vor der Thier Galerie finden sich weitere ParkplÃ¤tze',\n",

       "   'description': \"Please check the time in your timezone!\\n\\nDid you know that crows are better than toddlers at generating novel solutions? It's true! In the earliest days of childhood, around the globe scientists have documented that human cognition struggles to generate novel solutions. But we are adept at imitation, transmitting and teaching the solutions that we see others put into practice. What does this have to do with software, and innovation, and the cultures we want to create for the communities we love? I'm a psychologist fascinated by cycles of innovation in developer communities, and I think a simple reframe lights the way forward for our industry: in this talk, rather than focusing on what drives individual developer *productivity*, together weâre going to focus on the science of what drives developersâ collaborative *problem-solving*. We'll dive into the cognitive architecture of problem-solving, as well as what I've learned from leading empirical research with thousands of developers.\\n\\n**Dr Cat Hicks**\\nCat Hicks is a psychologist for software teams and defender of the mismeasured. She is the author of the Developer Thriving framework, the AI Skill Threat framework, and the VP of Research at Pluralsight. Cat is the founder of the Developer Success Lab, an open science research lab that creates empirical evidence about how organisations and individuals can achieve sustainable, resilient innovation in technology and create more well-being for technologists. Cat is also the founder of Catharsis Consulting, a scientific consultancy that connects organisations to human-centred evidence strategies. Cat holds a Ph.D. in Quantitative Experimental Psychology from UC San Diego, serves on the Advisory Council of the University of San Diego Center for Digital Civil Society, and is the author of a forthcoming book on the psychology of software teams.\",\n",

Large language models are touted as the solution for every problem under the sun. Yet, when it comes to everyday tasks like creating work schedules for 30 employees across 3 shifts or optimizing truck routes for 100 deliveries these models often derail.\\nFortunately, thereâs another branch of AI for solving these challenges. In this talk, weâll introduce you to Timefold, an open-source constraint solver which can tackle complex scheduling problems. With live demos, youâll see how by simply annotating your domain classes (just like you would annotate JPA entities) and defining your constraints, Timefold can generate an optimized schedule (no complex math required!).\\nBy the end of this session, youâll walk away with a powerful addition to your AI toolkit, ready to handle these kinds of tasks where LLMs stall and old-school AI shines. Weâll also explore how the old and new forms of AI can complement each other so you can create powerful hybrid AI solutions.\\n\\n**Speaker**\\n**Tom Cools, DevRel at Timefold, Java Champion, BeJUG organizer**\\n\\n**Host**\\n**Ixchel Ruiz, Senior Software Developer and Java Champion**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n**Join the Community!**\\nIf you haven't joined the Slack community, what are you waiting for?

We play 3v3 (or 4v4) with beach rules. There are no trainers at this event. Register via [the simultaneous event](https://www.meetup.com/berlin-volley/events/) for higher-level 2v2 matches.\\n\\nAfter playing, you can join us for socials with drinks and snacks at the bar area. We often play a social deduction game, which you can also join.\\n\\nIt's recommended that you come 10 minutes early so you have time to change and find the fields. If it is your first time, 15 minutes might be even better.\\n\\nBeware that the sand might be cold, so you might want to play with socks.\\n\\nYou can join whatever court you like and move between courts during the event. We self-organize, so once you finish a game, you can start a rematch, mix with another court, or take a break as you see fit. Upon arrival, join the warmup happening on one of the courts.\\n\\nJoin our WhatsApp community via [https://tinyurl.com/BerlinVolley](https://tinyurl.com/BerlinVolley)\\nFollow us on Insta at [https://www.instagram.com/berlinvolleyball](https://www.instagram.com/berlinvolleyball)\\n\\n**Rules**: Do not join if you have an infectious disease. For everyone's safety, we do not allow kicking the ball during games with beginners. Be respectful of your fellow players.\\n\\n**Venue**: We play at BeachMitte. There are changing rooms, toilets, and hot water showers that cost 1 EUR. There are no lockers. There is a bar that sells drinks and snacks.\\n\\n**Payment**: You pay in advance via Meetup. Payment via PayPal or Urban Sports Club is not possible.\\n\\n**Refunds**: The venue does not provide refunds. Thus, we cannot refund you either, even if the event is canceled due to bad weather. If you know you can't make it in advance, you can try selling your spot to someone else via WhatsApp or the comment section. In the rare cases that we cancel an event due to poor attendance, everyone gets a full refund.\\n\\nPictures might be taken and shared publicly, such as on Meetup or Instagram. You can opt out by letting the organizer know you do not wish to be photographed.\\n\\nBy RSVP'ing to this event, you acknowledge and agree to the following: Participation in this volleyball event is at your own risk.

Please try to arrive at the start on time!\\n\\nWe will go every week, also in winter!

The stair running is optional, you can take a short rest as well.\\n\\nOur pace is typically 5:30 to 6:00 min/km (10 to 11 km/h). Usually there are a few fast people pulling ahead, but don't worry, you won't be left behind, and we all meet at the stairs again :)\\n\\nOccasionally we may go for a drink after the run at the Castle across the street from the start/finish and claim a table in the garden if the weather is nice (late spring, summer, early autumn). If you are interested in that, bring some money. They do take cards as well.\\n\\nWe do NOT have a place to store your bag(s)/clothes, but some people reported success by asking in the Castle...\\n\\nLet's gooooo! ððð\",\n",

Wer schon mal schauen mÃ¶chte: https://www.wikifolio.com/de/de/w/wffff10000.

FÃ¼r all jene interessant, die sich als \"passive Investoren\" sehen, denn tiefgreifende Wirtschafts- und Marktkenntnisse sind fÃ¼r das VerstÃ¤ndnis der Performancequellen nicht erforderlich. Vielmehr wird die Performance aus der Struktur des Depot generiert, den Rest erledigt die Zeit. Wer mÃ¶chte kann sich auch bei der eigens dafÃ¼r gegrÃ¼ndeten Gruppe anmelden: \"[Die Investoren - Finanzen fÃ¼r Jedermann](https://www.meetup.com/dieinvestoren/?eventOrigin=your_groups)\".

       "   'title': 'Across The Gender Divide: Can Men and Women Really Be Friends? ',\n",
       "   'description': \"This session responds to a question that gets asked a lot at Friendshift - can men and women ever *really* be friends? In this session, we'll explore:\\n\\n* What we know from the research about how men and women typically approach friendship, including communication styles and preferences\\n* The complexities of friendships where there is the potential for sexual attraction, including exploring whether straight men and women can truly maintain platonic relationships without romantic feelings interfering.\\n* Societal norms, cultural influences, and personal experiences that shape our perceptions of friendships across the gender divide.\\n* The positives and pitfalls of cross-gender friendships\\n* Healthy strategies for building and maintaining healthy cross-gender friendships\\n\\n**What** **is a Friendshift Open Event?**\\nFriendshift by friendship coach Hannah Carmichael OBE is a small business offering courses, workshops, programmes and coaching services for thoughtful, reflective types (think friendly introverts!) who want more from their friendships.\\n\\nPart of the Friendshift mission is to make it normal to talk about friendship, and our Open Events are a part of that mission! Open Events are completely free to attend, and are held every two weeks on a Wednesday lunchtime (UK time / GMT). Each Open Event covers a different aspect of modern friendship, and topics are usually prompted by conversations between Hannah and her clients, or previous attendees!\\n\\n**PLEASE NOTE that all sessions are recorded, and AI transcripted.**\\n**Slides and / or recordings are shared afterwards by email, and extracts may be used on social media and elsewhere.**\\n\\n**Who is it for?**\\nHannah's events tend attract thoughtful, reflective, independent types - most of whom are aged over 30 and prefer to connect in more stereotypically introverted / lower-key ways. But you don't have to be this demographic to attend - if the topic sounds interesting and useful to you, and you want to find out more about building better friendships in a safe, supportive space, then you are very welcome to join.\\n\\n**Why should I attend?**\\n\\n* A chance to hear from other people who are on the same learning journey as you.\\n* Walk away with practical, evidence-based advice\\n* Opportunity to seek advice and support on friendship issues that you're facing\\n* Safe, welcoming, introvert-friendly spaces\\n\\n**What if I'm worried about talking on camera / taking part?**\\nIt's absolutely fine to get involved in Friendshift Open Events in whatever way feels most comfortable for you. We're very introvert-friendly! Sessions are interactive, with plenty of opportunities to contribute and ask questions via the chat, and by coming on camera. And because we deal with real life issues, everyone benefits when ideas and experiences are shared. But if you'd prefer to listen in with your camera off, that's absolutely fine too. Participants are sometimes offered the chance to breakout into smaller groups to aid learning - if this is part of the session plan, it will be mentioned at the start to give you time to decide if you would like to take part.\\n\\n**Your Facilitator**\\nHannah Carmichael OBE is a mum-of-one with ADHD and a serious coffee addiction. She is also a leading expert and sought-after coach specialising in friendship & connection, and is regularly featured in publications such as Stylist, Psychology Today, The Guardian, and BBC World Service. She is an expert panellist for BBC Radios Oxford & Berkshire. As a reformed 'awkward type,' Hannah loves nothing more than to see her clients recognising their worth and value, finding the confidence to show up fully as themselves, transforming their friendships, and building deep, authentic, wholehearted connections in all aspects of their lives.\",\n",

       "   'description': \"This session responds to a question that gets asked a lot at Friendshift - can men and women ever *really* be friends? In this session, we'll explore:\\n\\n* What we know from the research about how men and women typically approach friendship, including communication styles and preferences\\n* The complexities of friendships where there is the potential for sexual attraction, including exploring whether straight men and women can truly maintain platonic relationships without romantic feelings interfering.\\n* Societal norms, cultural influences, and personal experiences that shape our perceptions of friendships across the gender divide.\\n* The positives and pitfalls of cross-gender friendships\\n* Healthy strategies for building and maintaining healthy cross-gender friendships\\n\\n**What** **is a Friendshift Open Event?**\\nFriendshift by friendship coach Hannah Carmichael OBE is a small business offering courses, workshops, programmes and coaching services for thoughtful, reflective types (think friendly introverts!) who want more from their friendships.\\n\\nPart of the Friendshift mission is to make it normal to talk about friendship, and our Open Events are a part of that mission! Open Events are completely free to attend, and are held every two weeks on a Wednesday lunchtime (UK time / GMT). Each Open Event covers a different aspect of modern friendship, and topics are usually prompted by conversations between Hannah and her clients, or previous attendees!\\n\\n**PLEASE NOTE that all sessions are recorded, and AI transcripted.**\\n**Slides and / or recordings are shared afterwards by email, and extracts may be used on social media and elsewhere.**\\n\\n**Who is it for?**\\nHannah's events tend attract thoughtful, reflective, independent types - most of whom are aged over 30 and prefer to connect in more stereotypically introverted / lower-key ways. But you don't have to be this demographic to attend - if the topic sounds interesting and useful to you, and you want to find out more about building better friendships in a safe, supportive space, then you are very welcome to join.\\n\\n**Why should I attend?**\\n\\n* A chance to hear from other people who are on the same learning journey as you.\\n* Walk away with practical, evidence-based advice\\n* Opportunity to seek advice and support on friendship issues that you're facing\\n* Safe, welcoming, introvert-friendly spaces\\n\\n**What if I'm worried about talking on camera / taking part?**\\nIt's absolutely fine to get involved in Friendshift Open Events in whatever way feels most comfortable for you. We're very introvert-friendly! Sessions are interactive, with plenty of opportunities to contribute and ask questions via the chat, and by coming on camera. And because we deal with real life issues, everyone benefits when ideas and experiences are shared. But if you'd prefer to listen in with your camera off, that's absolutely fine too. Participants are sometimes offered the chance to breakout into smaller groups to aid learning - if this is part of the session plan, it will be mentioned at the start to give you time to decide if you would like to take part.\\n\\n**Your Facilitator**\\nHannah Carmichael OBE is a mum-of-one with ADHD and a serious coffee addiction. She is also a leading expert and sought-after coach specialising in friendship & connection, and is regularly featured in publications such as Stylist, Psychology Today, The Guardian, and BBC World Service. She is an expert panellist for BBC Radios Oxford & Berkshire. As a reformed 'awkward type,' Hannah loves nothing more than to see her clients recognising their worth and value, finding the confidence to show up fully as themselves, transforming their friendships, and building deep, authentic, wholehearted connections in all aspects of their lives.\",\n",

The dynamics of the Sensitive Collage project consist of creative exercises that induce the emergence of symbolic images, enabling psychic organisation through materialisation and opening up possibilities for these contents to be integrated into consciousness.\\n\\n**Objectives of the experience:**\\nÂ· To expand creative vision and intuition;\\nÂ· Cultivate presence;\\nÂ· To inspire creativity;\\nÂ· Practice mindfulness;\\nÂ· Promote mental health;\\nÂ· Materialise different feelings in a subjective way through collage.\\n\\n**Who can participate:** This experience is for anyone who is curious about themselves and wants to immerse themselves in their own creative universe, whose interests include visual arts, art therapy, collage, meditation, mental health and self-knowledge. **Only 10 spots!**\\n\\n**Project creator:** Vanessa Neuber is a visual artist, designer, and educator with a degree in Design and postgraduate studies in Art History and Analytical Psychology, specializing in Mythology, Tales, and Arts. Her specialization culminated in a research project focused on *Colagem Sensitiva* (Sensitive Collage). Additionally, Vanessa has deepened her expertise in art and therapy through the courses *Healing With The Arts* (University of Florida) and *SoulCollageÂ®*, a method created by Seena B. Frost. Collage and poetry have always been fundamental pillars of her creative journey, serving as powerful tools of inspiration. Meditation, in turn, nurtures and enhances her artistic process. A poet, Reiki Usui Shiki Ryoho Master, harmony agent, and messenger who celebrates art as an omnipresent gift, Vanessa imbues her works with a questioning and transformative essence. Her projects have been showcased in various exhibitions, fairs, workshops, and courses across Brazil and Latin America. Now based in Berlin, she continues to expand her artistic trajectory in Europe.\\n\\n**Important information:**\\nÂ· Materials included.\\nÂ· This workshop is a safe space where mutual respect is essential.

       "   'description': 'Welcome to our Backgammon Meetup group where we come together to play, socialize, learn and enjoy the game of Backgammon!\\nWhether you\\'re a beginner or a seasoned player, all are welcome to join us for games filled with laughter and friendly competition. Let\\'s meet up, roll the dice, and make some new friends along the way. So come join us for game Meetups that are sure to be a blast!\\n\\n**Please RSVP only if you plan to attend.**\\n\\n**How to play:**\\nBackgammon is a two-player board game that combines strategy and luck.\\n\\n1. **Setup**: Each player has 15 checkers, placed on a board with 24 triangular spaces called points. Players move in opposite directions, aiming to bring all their checkers (aka. stones or pieces) to their home board.\\n2. **Rolling Dice**: Players take turns rolling two six-sided dice. The numbers rolled determine how many points they can move their checkers.\\n3. **Moving Checkers**:\\n\\n* A checker can only land on an open point (not occupied by two or more of the opponent\\'s checkers).\\n* If a checker lands on a single opposing checker, it sends that checker to the bar, and it must re-enter the board before other moves.\\n\\n4. **Bearing Off**: Once all of a playerâs checkers are in their home board, they can start \"bearing off,\" removing checkers based on dice rolls.\\n5. **Winning**: The first player to remove all their checkers wins the game.\\n\\nAll levels are welcome!\\n\\n**The Origin of Backgammon:**\\nBackgammon is one of the oldest known board games, with roots deeply embedded in the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia. But it is in Persia, where the game truly flourished and evolved into what we now know as \\'Takhte Nard\\'.\\nArchaeological findings suggest that early forms of backgammon were played in Iran over 5,000 years ago. Artifacts such as game boards and dice have been discovered in sites like \\'Shahr-e Sukhteh\\' (The Burnt City), indicating the gameâs ancient origins.\\n\\n**Backgammon Berlin WhatsApp Group:**\\n[https://chat.whatsapp.com/IJNxotb9f75ItGm5eBzp7L](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IJNxotb9f75ItGm5eBzp7L)\\nGroup joinable only AFTER attendance. :)',\n",

       "   'description': '**Code Reading Club Session (Beginner, online)**\\nMoT Munich presents a very special online event for all testers (with little or no understanding of code): A code reading session by @samuel Nitsche\\n\\nâIf you want to learn how to code or get better at coding, just start a side project!â\\n\\nâThere are so many tutorials out there, just start coding.â\\n\\nâYou need to figure it out yourself!â\\n\\nMaybe youâve heard these or similar statements, and maybe they felt discouraging. Bite-sized tutorials in artificial environments, doing a lot of typing, and figuring out things on your own via trial and error are still the most widespread teaching techniques for learning to code or getting better at coding.\\nThere is, however, an alternative approach. Even full-time developers spend 60% of their time reading code and scientific research suggests that learning Java is not so different from learning French. So what if instead of typing away we would focus on reading actual code and using the same techniques as for natural languages to learn and get a deeper understanding of a programming language?\\nLetâs jointly examine an unknown piece of code and use different techniques to get an understanding of the how and what. In this highly collaborative session we will explore some of the following questions:\\n\\n* What elements does a programming language consist of?\\n* How can we differentiate the elements and get a better understanding of what code does?\\n* How can we use visualization techniques to understand the data flow?\\n* What can we do when we approach a piece of unfamiliar code?\\n\\n**This session is for all people who always wanted to understand a bit better what code does and how it works, no matter if they worked with or adjacent to coding before or not.**\\n**Approx. length: 90 minutes**\\n\\n**Speaker profile:**\\n\\nSamuel Nitsche is a curiosity-driven software developer who programs, learns and collaborates in the software trade since the early 2000s.\\n\\nHis primary interest is in code quality, code reading, modern database development, and automated testing, topics he writes regularly about on different platforms (e.g. his blog [https://developer-sam.de](https://developer-sam.de/ \"https://developer-sam.de/\"), Simple-Talk, and several Oracle-related print magazines).\\nHe is an Oracle ACE alumni, a Symposium 42 member, a MASH (Mentor and Speaker Hub, [http://mashprogram.wordpress.com](http://mashprogram.wordpress.com/ \"http://mashprogram.wordpress.com/\")) core member and has been one of the main contributors and maintainers of utPLSQL ([http://utplsql.org](http://utplsql.org/ \"http://utplsql.org/\")).\\nAs a workshop facilitator, speaker, and keynote speaker he loves to share his experience in an entertaining way - gladly collaborating with plush animals and using lightsabers - at meetups and conferences.',\n",

       "   'title': 'NVC & Relationships: Connecting in Conflict',\n",
       "   'description': 'About these workshops\\nHow can it be that in our closest, most intimate relationship the most mess happens?\\nIn the place where there is the most love, painful conflicts reign recurrently. And all of a sudden, who was our dearest support and companion seems now to be our enemy.\\nAnd this happens both with someone else, and within ourselves.\\nIn fact, the strongest violence I\\'ve ever witnessed is in how I relate to myself. If I\\'d treat my friends like I treat myself, I\\'d have none.\\nYou know that feeling?\\nI try to plan the weekend with my partner, and all of a sudden they are convinced I don\\'t care about them.\\nI\\'m enthusiastically trying to decide what things I want to tackle today from my to-do list, and I end up feeling lost and thinking I\\'m a failure.I wanted to create more safety by bringing up that what my lover did yesterday wasn\\'t cool for me, and now it seems I don\\'t matter to them.\\nSo, how to approach these painful conflicts and transform them into an occasion for more intimacy and connection?\\nWe created a series of 4 workshops with different topics that I believe will leave you with useful skills to start transforming these moments:\\nWorkshop Topics:\\n1) Love and intimacy\\nSometimes, we struggle in the dearest intimate connections we have. Weâll start with a compassionate space to acknowledge this.\\nThen, we will dive deep into the question: What does intimacy mean to me? What is that thing that brings us together?\\nFinally, we will explore how judgments prevent intimacy and create separation? We will learn how to use them as a door to connect deeper to ourselves and each other.\\n2) Empathic listening\\nI like to define conflict as \"two people speaking at the same time, while no one is listening\".\\nListening is fundamental to exit this constellation, and no one really taught us how to do it.\\nWe are tragically left without the most basic skill to nourish connection in conflict.\\nIn this workshop, we will learn what empathy is and what it is not, how to meet each other where we are at, and how to really be able to listen and enjoy it as well. We will also practice how to navigate a difficult dialogue without losing clarity, compassion and care for both my own and my partner\\'s needs, independently from their ability to do so, so that we can grow and thrive together.\\n3) Honesty\\nâIf I canât be me, there is no one left loving youâ Y.M.\\nThe eternal dilemma of being honest.\\nHow can I be fully myself and care for our intimate connection?\\nHow to share the deepest, most uncomfortable truths that create intimacy, without touching pain that could break the connection?\\nHow to ask for our wildest dreams, when they are so vulnerable to reveal?\\nHow to hear a ânoâ to our deepest wishes?\\nWe will navigate the discomfort of these dilemmas together, while practicing tools to navigate these difficult dialogues.\\n4) Connecting in conflict\\nConflicts tend to get very messy very fast.\\nLet\\'s learn how to validate the reality of who we are listening to without abandoning our own. Weâll learn how to make heartfelt, effective apologies without digging ourselves a guilt hole, but create an occasion for repair and closeness.\\nWe will end the workshop series with the most simple and powerful tool to connect us with love: Gratitude.\\nThis is the fuel that allows me to stay in the wheel of giving and receiving.\\nLet\\'s learn the pitfalls of how it\\'s commonly used, and how to express it so that it nourishes our connections.\\nFor whom is this workshop?\\nEveryone. As if you are not in an intimate romantic relationship with someone else right now, you surely are in an intimate connection with yourself, and maybe others. You know that voice that starts talking in your head if you stop reading for a minute? Maybe the one saying \"Which voice is she talking about?\"\\nTeaching style\\nThe workshops will be around 70% practice and demonstrations, and 30% theory. We chose this approach as we believe it supports learning in the body through practice.You\\'ll be invited to bring up experiences from your life. So, if you want, get ready to get real!\\nWorkshop Dates & Times:\\nï¿½ Sundays at K77 Studio, Berlin\\n30/3 \\\\| 17:30 \\\\- 19:30 â Love and Intimacy\\n6/4 \\\\| 12:30 \\\\- 14:30 â Empathic Listening\\n13/4 \\\\| 18:00 \\\\- 20:00 â Honesty\\n28/4 \\\\| 18:00 \\\\- 20:00 â Connecting in Conflict\\nï¿½ Location: K77 Studio, Kastanienallee 77, 10435 BerlinGoogle Maps link\\nï¿½ Entrance Instructions:\\nEnter the open main door.\\nPass the second door (if closed, ring the bell K77 and push while ringing).\\nEnter the small door at the front left corner of the courtyard.\\nGo up to the third floor.\\nï¿½ Please park bikes outside the building complex.\\nDo I have to attend all the workshops?\\nYou get the most transformative effect out of it when you come to all of them, as they do partially build on top of each other.\\nAt the same time, also taking them singularly is meaningful and will leave you with something.\\nWho?\\nMartina Pesce - Crafting Dialogues\\nHi, I\\'m Martina. I came in contact with Nonviolent Communication (NVC) through a relationship where I started to grasp the beauty of this tool. After 3 years of self-study and occasional practice, I was touched by how this communication allowed me to connect with my mum in conflict, so strongly that I felt love for her for the first time in 20 years.\\nUnsatisfied with the lack of mental health support in the neuroscience research field, I decided to switch careers and dive deep into NVC. I trained as a mediator, counsellor and trainer at the Connecting2life school (Yoram Mosenzon). It was a two-year-long process of embodying the tool and then learning how to transmit it so that it could sink in the body. For more than a couple of years I\\'ve been holding my workshops, courses, and 1:1 practice.\\nMy approach is based on practice and embodiment.\\nI found NVC very revolutionary and with that respect, I like to let sink in our system a few bits of info at the time, rather than an overwhelming waterfall of theory.\\nI have also been teaching Tantra Yoga (1 on 1 guidance, tantric hatha yoga, yoni massages) since a bit less than a year.\\nMatthias Flury\\nHi. My name is Matthias. To be honest with you, Iâm incredibly hesitant to write this short biography about myself. Part of the resistance comes from a fear of not being enough - itâs an insecurity that often comes alive since for many years of my life my need for connection wasnât met, no matter what I tried. Out of this experience Iâm shy to show and present myself, even to an unknown reader, to not go through the pain of rejection again. Another source for this hesitation is that Iâve got an idea of how I need to present myself here as a teacher. âI need to sell myself well and in a way that will make you trust me and curious to learn from meâ. And Iâm worried that Iâll try to perform as something Iâm not in order to achieve that. Underneath the pressure of trying to be perfect Iâm certain Iâll loose something incredibly important. Iâll lose connection to myself and with that any hope of actually contributing value to you.\\nThatâs why Iâll start this introduction of myself like this. Iâm looking forward to meeting you and exploring together how we can connect to our feelings and unknown desires. How we can hold space and lovingly meet each other exactly where we are in our authentic selves. This is the place where relationships gain intimacy and depth, where love grows and where life begins to make sense.\\nJust in case you actually want to know about my background: I started learning about NVC in 2019, took my first lessons with Empathie Stadt Zurich in 2020, and completed my education in 2023 with a course about teaching and embodying NVC by CNVC-Trainer Yoram Mosenzon. I regularly support NVC-teachers as an assistant in their courses and occasionally teach myself.

But what if we told you that the secrets to resilience lie not only in our experiences but also in the profound intersections of neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and biology? Welcome to a transformative journey, a workshop unlike any other, where we uncover the incredible science behind resilience and equip you with practical tools to navigate your emotions like never before.\\n**The Resilience Revolution:**\\nThe human experience is a mosaic of emotions, a tapestry woven with threads of joy, sorrow, hope, and fear. Each emotion serves as a compass guiding our actions and reactions.

Our experts have delved into the depths of the human mind and soul, drawing from cutting-edge neuroscience to understand the intricate workings of the brain, diving into psychology to decipher the complexities of our emotions, and tapping into the timeless wisdom of philosophy to seek answers to life\\'s profound questions. Additionally, biology unveils the astounding resilience mechanisms that have evolved within us over millennia.\\n**Empowering You to Thrive:**\\nAttendees of this workshop will embark on a fascinating journey through the realms of the mind and soul, guided by our renowned experts. Together, we will explore both the negative and positive emotions that shape our lives, demystifying their origins and discovering how they influence our resilience. But this workshop is not just about theory; it\\'s about practicality.\\n**Practical Tools for Everyday Resilience:**\\nYou won\\'t leave this workshop with abstract theories alone. You will gain practical tools, strategies, and techniques rooted in science and philosophy to effectively navigate your emotions, boost your resilience, and transform your life.

Is AI eliminating gig work or enhancing freelance opportunities for everyone? Will algorithmic bosses enslave human workers or free them from traditional management? Is AGI already here or can we wait a while longer? And what role will humans have in the future of work?\\nThis session unpacks highlights from the new book *Human Robot Agent* so that we can explore dilemmas, navigate complexity, and harness AI to thrive in a socio-technological and wicked world.\\n**Learning Objectives:**\\n\\n1. **Understand AI\\'s Role in New Ways of Working:** Identify how technology reshapes traditional business structures and ways of working.\\n2. **Embrace Disruptive Innovation:** Learn an actionable mindset to lead change and be the disruptor rather than embracing change and be the disrupted.\\n3. **Cultivate New Skills and Mindsets:** Explore the shift towards multi-skilled (M-skilled) workers, critical thinkers, and adaptive leaders in AI-driven environments.\\n\\nThe meetup will be moderated by [JÃ¼rgen Dittmar.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juergendittmar/)',\n",

Similar career choices, boy troubles, dancing crazyy on bollywood beats, making chai pakore and ranting for hours- back home, this would happen so organically but here we are busy, sometimes our jobs are too much and sometimes we canât just fall asleep or we donât get a termin! (and also sometimes tired or socially burnt out!)\\n\\nLetâs use this meetup group as a way to re-connect in those organic ways. Much like at home, connect over chai and samosa or have a full meal! Or have wine! (why not?)\\n\\nHow would this meetup work?\\nI come with a question card game and we answer them in small groups. This keeps the conversation lively and helps connect authentically!\\n\\n** Fee- The fee is to pay back the meetup app fee that I pay as an organisor. Regular members pay only 1â¬ using the promo code. Ask me personally :)\\nYou can paypal me to mimansabhardwaj@gmail.com under âfriends and familyâ. See you!',\n",

In the Buddhist tradition, meditation is more than just a way to end the mindÂ´s distraction - it is what helps us to bring our mind home to its true nature.\\n\\nWhat better way to experience the colourful facets of meditation than with a group of like-minded people? Hence our open meditation sessions always have a social element as well - we like to have a tea and share about our meditation experiences, or whatever else we want to explore. There is also always the chance to ask questions to our experienced meditation instructors.\\n\\nThese sessions are held in English and open to everyone - complete beginners as well as those with more experience.\\n\\nThe sessions are every week on Friday at 17:00-18:30.',\n",

       "   'description': 'The eternal dilemma of being honest.\\nHow can I be fully myself and care for our intimate connection?\\n\\nAbout these workshops\\nHow can it be that in our closest, most intimate relationship the most mess happens?\\nIn the place where there is the most love, painful conflicts reign recurrently. And all of a sudden, who was our dearest support and companion seems now to be our enemy.\\nAnd this happens both with someone else, and within ourselves.\\nIn fact, the strongest violence I\\'ve ever witnessed is in how I relate to myself. If I\\'d treat my friends like I treat myself, I\\'d have none.\\n\\nYou know that feeling?\\nI try to plan the weekend with my partner, and all of a sudden they are convinced I don\\'t care about them.\\nI\\'m enthusiastically trying to decide what things I want to tackle today from my to-do list, and I end up feeling lost and thinking I\\'m a failure.I wanted to create more safety by bringing up that what my lover did yesterday wasn\\'t cool for me, and now it seems I don\\'t matter to them.\\nSo, how to approach these painful conflicts and transform them into an occasion for more intimacy and connection?\\nWe created a series of 4 workshops with different topics that I believe will leave you with useful skills to start transforming these moments:\\n\\nWorkshop Topics:\\n1) Love and intimacy\\nSometimes, we struggle in the dearest intimate connections we have. Weâll start with a compassionate space to acknowledge this.\\nThen, we will dive deep into the question: What does intimacy mean to me? What is that thing that brings us together?\\nFinally, we will explore how judgments prevent intimacy and create separation? We will learn how to use them as a door to connect deeper to ourselves and each other.\\n\\n2) Empathic listening\\nI like to define conflict as \"two people speaking at the same time, while no one is listening\".\\nListening is fundamental to exit this constellation, and no one really taught us how to do it.\\nWe are tragically left without the most basic skill to nourish connection in conflict.\\nIn this workshop, we will learn what empathy is and what it is not, how to meet each other where we are at, and how to really be able to listen and enjoy it as well. We will also practice how to navigate a difficult dialogue without losing clarity, compassion and care for both my own and my partner\\'s needs, independently from their ability to do so, so that we can grow and thrive together.\\n\\n3) Honesty\\nâIf I canât be me, there is no one left loving youâ Y.M.\\nThe eternal dilemma of being honest.\\nHow can I be fully myself and care for our intimate connection?\\nHow to share the deepest, most uncomfortable truths that create intimacy, without touching pain that could break the connection?\\nHow to ask for our wildest dreams, when they are so vulnerable to reveal?\\nHow to hear a ânoâ to our deepest wishes?\\nWe will navigate the discomfort of these dilemmas together, while practicing tools to navigate these difficult dialogues.\\n\\n4) Connecting in conflict\\nConflicts tend to get very messy very fast.\\nLet\\'s learn how to validate the reality of who we are listening to without abandoning our own. Weâll learn how to make heartfelt, effective apologies without digging ourselves a guilt hole, but create an occasion for repair and closeness.\\nWe will end the workshop series with the most simple and powerful tool to connect us with love: Gratitude.\\nThis is the fuel that allows me to stay in the wheel of giving and receiving.\\nLet\\'s learn the pitfalls of how it\\'s commonly used, and how to express it so that it nourishes our connections.\\n\\nFor whom is this workshop?\\nEveryone. As if you are not in an intimate romantic relationship with someone else right now, you surely are in an intimate connection with yourself, and maybe others. You know that voice that starts talking in your head if you stop reading for a minute? Maybe the one saying \"Which voice is she talking about?\"\\n\\nTeaching style\\nThe workshops will be around 70% practice and demonstrations, and 30% theory. We chose this approach as we believe it supports learning in the body through practice.You\\'ll be invited to bring up experiences from your life.

I came in contact with Nonviolent Communication (NVC) through a relationship where I started to grasp the beauty of this tool. After 3 years of self-study and occasional practice, I was touched by how this communication allowed me to connect with my mum in conflict, so strongly that I felt love for her for the first time in 20 years.\\nUnsatisfied with the lack of mental health support in the neuroscience research field, I decided to switch careers and dive deep into NVC. I trained as a mediator, counsellor and trainer at the Connecting2life school (Yoram Mosenzon). It was a two-year-long process of embodying the tool and then learning how to transmit it so that it could sink in the body. For more than a couple of years I\\'ve been holding my workshops, courses, and 1:1 practice.\\nMy approach is based on practice and embodiment.\\nI found NVC very revolutionary and with that respect, I like to let sink in our system a few bits of info at the time, rather than an overwhelming waterfall of theory.\\nI have also been teaching Tantra Yoga (1 on 1 guidance, tantric hatha yoga, yoni massages) since a bit less than a year.\\n\\nMatthias Flury\\nHi. My name is Matthias. To be honest with you, Iâm incredibly hesitant to write this short biography about myself. Part of the resistance comes from a fear of not being enough - itâs an insecurity that often comes alive since for many years of my life my need for connection wasnât met, no matter what I tried. Out of this experience Iâm shy to show and present myself, even to an unknown reader, to not go through the pain of rejection again. Another source for this hesitation is that Iâve got an idea of how I need to present myself here as a teacher. âI need to sell myself well and in a way that will make you trust me and curious to learn from meâ. And Iâm worried that Iâll try to perform as something Iâm not in order to achieve that. Underneath the pressure of trying to be perfect Iâm certain Iâll loose something incredibly important. Iâll lose connection to myself and with that any hope of actually contributing value to you.\\nThatâs why Iâll start this introduction of myself like this. Iâm looking forward to meeting you and exploring together how we can connect to our feelings and unknown desires. How we can hold space and lovingly meet each other exactly where we are in our authentic selves. This is the place where relationships gain intimacy and depth, where love grows and where life begins to make sense.\\nJust in case you actually want to know about my background: I started learning about NVC in 2019, took my first lessons with Empathie Stadt Zurich in 2020, and completed my education in 2023 with a course about teaching and embodying NVC by CNVC-Trainer Yoram Mosenzon. I regularly support NVC-teachers as an assistant in their courses and occasionally teach myself.

In a city where the conversation about mental health is often shrouded in silence, Mindful Mingle welcomes openness and emotional honesty.\\n\\n**A Bit About Me and Why This Group**\\nI'm not an organization or a seasoned event planner â just someone who believes in the power of sharing and listening. Sure, I have my doubts (who doesn't?), but I'm taking the leap anyway. If you, like me, have been searching for a space where you can be real about how you're doing... really doing, then this might just be for you.\\n\\n**Meeting Structure:**\\n\\n1. **Introductions**\\n2. **The Check-In**\\n3. **Empathy Game**\\n4. **Mingle & Muse**\\n\\n**1.** In the introduction phase, we settle in the cafÃ©, get comfortable, and wait for everyone to arrive. It is important to arrive on time for this phase or let us know if you are delayed. If you cannot attend, please update your RSVP as soon as possible.\\n\\n**2.** In the check-in phase, you can share with the group how you have been doing in recent weeks. The level of depth you choose to share is up to you. Since the goal is for everyone to have a chance to participate and to create a safe, accepting environment without judgment, follow-up questions or comments are not encouraged.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Empathy Game: Playfully connect on a deeper level**\\nEmpathy fuels connection, but what does real connection look like in the digital age? When do we truly listen and engage with each otherâs stories?\\nThe game is simple: pick a card, share a story, and let listeners respond by rolling a dice to explore their own experiences.\\nThe Empathy Game fosters sharing, listening, and vulnerability.\\n\\n**4.** In the Mingle and Muse phase, the group will no longer be moderated by the host. You are free to mingle with anyoneâwhether to follow up on a previous topic, ask a question, share your thoughts, or connect over a shared experience. To avoid forgetting ideas that came to you earlier in the session, having a pen and paper handy could be useful.\\n\\n**Who is this meetup for?\\\\***\\n\\n* You have experience with therapy.\\n* You are mindful of other people's vulnerability.\\n* You can articulate and explain your thoughts and feelings.\\n* You have a genuine interest in this topic.\\n* Not everything seems fabulous and awesome in your life right now.\\n* You didnât join just because you couldnât find something else to do.\\n* You would feel responsible and commited that you RSVPed (e.g., by putting it in your calendar).\\n* Preferably, you live in Berlin or nearby.\\n\\n**Important note on RSVP:\\\\***\\nThe reason behind my emphasis on updating RSVPs is that the idea is for us all to sit in a circle so everyone can be heard. When the RSVP is not updated we expect more number of poeple, and it can cause stress as I try to figure out how and where to fit everyone. We would also wait to start until everyone who is coming has arrived so that they can be involved from the beginningâunderstanding the structure, knowing who is present, hearing the introduction, and feeling welcomed.\\n\\nBesides that, irresponsible RSVPs might prevent others from joining who could have attended and needed a setting like this. It can also make people with social anxiety feel more anxious when seeing a high number of attendees, which doesn't reflect the actual attendance rate.\\n\\nI hope you can imagine and relate to what happens behind the scenes, and update your RSVP if needed. :)\\n\\n**If you're anxious about joining, feel free to contact me personally.\\\\***\\nIf you'd like to attend but aren't sure about feeling comfortable, it might help to mention that you're reaching out for this reason.

Some questions we might explore:\\n* Which platforms work best for different types of authors?\\n* How do you **find and engage your ideal audience**?\\n* Is social media necessary, or can authors promote themselves in other ways?\\n* Do you have an author website? Do you need one?\\n* Whatâs realistic in terms of **time commitment** vs. return?\\n* Memoir is personalâ**how much do we want to share?** What boundaries feel right?\\n* Our thoughts about sharing non-memoir related content.\\n* Share whatever **resources** (books, courses, blog posts) on the topic that we've found useful.\\n\\n### **Part 2: Optional Cross-Promotion & Support**\\n\\nFor those who are interested, we can:\\n\\n* Share our **social media links** (for those who want to connect and follow each other naturally).\\n* Support each other in ways that **feel genuine**âwhether thatâs by reading each otherâs work, commenting, sharing posts, or leaving reviews.\\n* Discuss **Nutan & Brendaâs Medium experiment**âdoes regular engagement help grow an audience?\\n\\n**NOTE:** Some members have raised concerns about **artificial engagement hurting their reach**, so this will be **entirely opt-in**.

Candidates embrace AI for CVs and cover letters, while Talent Acquisition teams use it for job descriptions and evaluations.\\n\\n**The promise?** Faster processes, reduced workload and more objective hiring decisions. But there is a catch â AI bias. Hidden biases (beyond gender and racial discrimination) impact who gets shortlisted, who gets overlooked and, ultimately, who gets hired.\\n\\nIf youâre curious about AI bias in recruitment â how to detect it, what impact it has and, most importantly, what you can do about it, this meetup is for you.\\n\\nJoin us as we explore key strategies to ensure AI enhances your hiring process without filtering out top talent.

Wenn losgelÃ¶ste Aufmerksamkeit auf den reinen Wunsch nach dem Guten trifft, entsteht eine Dynamik im Energiefeld, das uns alle umgibt.\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Elizabeth reminded me of the upcoming 100th anniversary of THE GREAT GATSBY. Thank you, Elizabeth!\\n\\nIt is a great opportunity for us to read or re-read and discuss this work of fiction.\\n\\nAn opinion piece in the NYT explains why it is such an important book:\\nâSuppose I told you a story about a handsome young charlatan who amassed a fortune as the front for a criminal enterprise, set up a fake identity and bought himself a certain kind of celebrity and then dazzled and seduced another manâs wife and nearly persuaded her to run away with him.\\n\\nWho would you imagine to be the innocent victim, even the martyr, in the story? Maybe the married woman, maybe her cuckolded husband. Probably not the criminal and fraud. Unless, that is, you recognize this opening as a summary of âThe Great Gatsby,â F. Scott Fitzgeraldâs novel about the innocence of the mountebank and his martyrdom at the hands of the wealthy married couple he tries to come between.\\n\\nThis reversal is part of what makes âGatsbyâ such an essential American text. Its main characterâs arc unites two conflicting aspects of our national identity â our commercial wealth and our naÃ¯ve idealism, our material aspirations and our sense of ourselves as Godâs elect â through the idea that innocence resides in the person on the make, while possession and inheritance are suspect, dubious, corrupt.â\\n\\nSo, put your drink on ice and light the candles. :)',\n",

We will also examine how to identify ineffective leadership practices and respond with constructive feedback. You might receive a warm thank you for your thoughtfulness. Are you open to simulating and having fun as we learn the skills to Gap That Leadership?\\nThe Generative Adaptive Practice (GAP) employs eight principles to guide effective leadership in creating environments where people can thrive. They include the following:\\n\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*Abundance Mindset\\\\*\\\\*: Helping leaders and teams recognize opportunities for growth and improvement.\\n2. \\\\*\\\\*Focus on WE (Willing and Enabled): Cultivate a team culture where individuals feel empowered and inspired.\\n3. \\\\*\\\\*We Trust You to Achieve Our Goals\\\\*\\\\*: Decisions and actions must be transparent to foster trust.\\n4. \\\\*\\\\*Win and Lose as a Team\\\\*\\\\*: Leaders adopt a mindset that embraces successes and failures, learning from each. Failure is an opportunity for new learning and growth.\\n5. \\\\*\\\\*Partner and Have Conversations to Learn More\\\\*\\\\*: Establish open communication channels to guide teams effectively.\\n6. \\\\*\\\\*Run the Experiment and Evaluate the Hypothesis\\\\*\\\\*: Leaders utilize adaptive practices to explore new ideas with an open mind and assess their potential.

The ability to read code is a separate skill that is often overlooked, and even programmers lack proficiency or effectiveness in this area. Yet, the capacity to efficiently comprehend and interpret code is crucial for successfully navigating the technological landscape, especially with all the new code created by generative AI.\\nLetâs jointly examine an unknown piece of code and use different techniques to get an understanding of the how and why. In this highly collaborative session in which we will explore some of the following questions:\\n\\n* What can we do when we approach a piece of unfamiliar code?\\n* How can we use visualization techniques to understand the data flow?\\n* Which pieces of information can we use to understand what the code does?\\n* What can we learn about the decisions made in the code and their consequences?\\n* How do other people read code?\\n\\nThere is no right or wrong, no winner or competition: The goal is to reflect on how we read code and practice some techniques that can help to get a quicker and deeper understanding of the code.\\nThis session is for people who have had some exposure to code (what are variables, functions, conditions).\\n\\nThe session can provide value for a lot of people in different roles adjacent to coding, but people without basic programming knowledge might get less value out of it.\\nApprox. length: 90 minutes\\n\\n**Speaker profile:**\\n\\nSamuel Nitsche is a curiosity-driven software developer who programs, learns and collaborates in the software trade since the early 2000s.\\n\\nHis primary interest is in code quality, code reading, modern database development, and automated testing, topics he writes regularly about on different platforms (e.g. his blog [https://developer-sam.de](https://developer-sam.de/ \"https://developer-sam.de/\"), Simple-Talk, and several Oracle-related print magazines).\\nHe is an Oracle ACE alumni, a Symposium 42 member, a MASH (Mentor and Speaker Hub, [http://mashprogram.wordpress.com](http://mashprogram.wordpress.com/ \"http://mashprogram.wordpress.com/\")) core member and has been one of the main contributors and maintainers of utPLSQL ([http://utplsql.org](http://utplsql.org/ \"http://utplsql.org/\")).\\nAs a workshop facilitator, speaker, and keynote speaker he loves to share his experience in an entertaining way - gladly collaborating with plush animals and using lightsabers - at meetups and conferences.',\n",

Da die ersten (meist herausfordernderen) Tage am Wochenende liegen, musst du theoretisch auch keinen Urlaub nehmen. Es sollte aber dafÃ¼r gesorgt sein, dass im Fasten-Fenster keine super stressigen Termine liegen und Du Zeit fÃ¼r Ruhe einplanen kannst.\\n\\nZeitgleich wollen wir beim Fasten aber auch Reize setzen und nicht nur auf dem Sofa liegen - unter gesunder metabolischer FlexibilitÃ¤t ist es also absolut machbar den \"normalen\" Alltag zu bewÃ¤ltigen. Ein wenig \"Innsicht\" ist aber sicherlich auch nicht falsch - wie immer ist Balance hier der SchlÃ¼ssel.\\n\\n**Fastenart**\\nWir orientieren uns am Wasserfasten - was aber nicht bedeutet, dass du nur Wasser und Tee trinken darfst. Es geht vor allem darum maximal von den gesundheitsassoziierten ZustÃ¤nden der Autophagie und Ketose zu profitieren. Welche Nahrungsmittel da ggf. integriert werden dÃ¼rfen bzw. sogar hilfreich sein kÃ¶nnen und warum erfahrt ihr in der Email vorab.\\n\\n**Fastenbegleitung**\\n\\n1. Es wird insgesamt 3 Zoom Calls geben, in denen wir uns Austauschen & ich euch Impulse zum Fastenprozess geben werde. (siehe unten)\\n2. Zudem wird es eine Telegramm Gruppe fÃ¼r den Austausch geben.\\n3. DarÃ¼ber hinaus stehe ich Euch bei Fragen via Telegram zur VerfÃ¼gung und bin Ã¼ber die Fastentage tagsÃ¼ber erreichbar.\\n4. Ich werde euch spÃ¤testens 14 Tage vor Fastenstart eine ausfÃ¼hrliche Email senden, mit einem Fastenguide, Infos, Tipps und Tricks rund um das Fasten & die Vorbereitung:\\n\\n\\\\* was ist das Ziel / GrÃ¼nde fÃ¼r das Fasten?\\n\\\\* Wie merke ich ob ich in Ketose bin?\\n\\\\* Was kann ich tun um schneller in Ketose zu kommen?\\n\\\\* Woran merke ich dass ich ggf. abbrechen sollte?\\n\\\\* Welche Gesundheitsparameter dienen mir als Orientierung?\\n\\\\* Welche Supplements kÃ¶nnen sinnvoll sein?\\n\\\\* Was darf ich trotz Fastenmodus zu mir nehmen?\\n\\\\* uvm.\\n\\n**Dauer 3-5 Tage**\\nDie Dauer deiner Fastenzeit bestimmst Du, im Einklang mit deinem KÃ¶rper und deinem Empfinden. Nach aktueller wissenschaftlicher Datenlage ist ein Fastenfester von 3-5 Tagen am wirkungsvollsten & sinnvoller als zB 10 Tage am StÃ¼ck zu fasten. Wir profitieren so optimal von Autophagie (dem AufrÃ¤umen in den Zellen) und Ketose. Wie lange du teilnimmst kannst du entweder vorab oder aber auch spontan entscheiden. Ich stehe dir da gern zur Seite.\\n\\n**Live Calls / Zoom Calls zur \"Begleitung\"**\\n\\n* 10\\\\. April: 17\\\\.00 Uhr Fastenstart \\\\(Zoom Call No1\\\\)\\n* 12\\\\.

GrundsÃ¤tzlich gibt es ein paar \"KontraIndikationen\", bei denen nach RÃ¼cksprache mit einer Ãrzt\\\\*in ggf. auf das Fasten verzichtet werden sollte.\\n\\nNicht ohne Ã¤rztliches \"Go\" fasten sollten:\\n\\n* Frauen mit bestehender hypothalamischer Amenorrhoe oder chronisch unterkalorischer ErnÃ¤hrung\\n* Frauen mit sehr niedrigem KÃ¶rperfett (<17%) und MÃ¤nner (<8%) sollten nur unter Ã¤rztlicher Begleitung Wasserfasten\\n* Menschen mit EssstÃ¶rungen (auch in der Vergangenheit)\\n* Schwangerschaft und Stillzeit\\n* Menschen mit fortgeschrittenen Herzkrankheiten\\n\\nDas Fasten und die Anmeldung erfolgen auf eigene Gefahr und liegen in der jeweiligen Verantwortung der einzelnen Teilnehmenden.

Please consider giving Dana before or after via PayPal: SacredPresenceDana@gmail.com\\n\\n***PLEASE NOTE:*** If this is your first time joining our circle, it\\'s essential that you take a few moments to read through the guiding principles beforehand. These principles form the foundation of our space, ensuring a respectful, supportive, and safe environment for all. Familiarizing yourself with them will help you feel more grounded and aligned with the flow of the group.\\n\\n**GUIDING PRINCIPLES**\\n\\n* **Speak from the \\'I\\' Perspective**\\nWe commit to sharing from personal experience, using \"I\" statements to express our own feelings and thoughts. This encourages authenticity and helps foster a deeper connection with ourselves and others.\\n* **Respect for Silence**\\nEvery man has the right to share or remain silent. Silence is just as valid as speech, and we honor each individual\\'s choice to contribute in the way that feels right for him.\\n* **Focused Attention**\\nEach man\\'s story holds equal significance. When a man speaks, he has the full attention of the group. We listen attentively and without interruption until he has finished.\\n* **Clarification, Not Obligation**\\nAfter a man has finished speaking, others may ask if he is open to questions for the purpose of clarification. However, the speaker is under no obligation to respond or engage further.\\n* **No Unsolicited Advice**\\nWe refrain from offering advice unless the speaker explicitly requests it. If advice is sought, the speaker may define the specific boundaries for it. Any advice given should also come from an \\'I\\' perspective, rooted in personal experience, rather than external knowledge or secondhand insights.\\n* **Courageous and Honest Communication**\\nAs speakers, we strive to be as clear, brave, and honest in our language as possible. We also work to quiet our inner critics and trust in the good intentions of our listeners.\\n* **Confidentiality**\\nWhat is shared within the group stays within the group. This includes both the stories told and the identities of those present. Confidentiality is the foundation of trust in our circle.\\n\\n**Lateness policy:** To maintain the flow and integrity of our circle, it\\'s essential that we begin together. Once the welcome round is complete (approximately five minutes after the official start time), entry to the video call will be closed. This ensures a focused and uninterrupted space for all participants.',\n",

Thanks to this misplaced over-confidence this talk presents potions,\\na command-line arguments parsing library written in Unison ([https://unison-lang.org](https://unison-lang.org)).\\n\\nWe will start with a tour of the library features: various type of options, support for environment variables, styled help, and more.\\nWe will then dive into the implementation of the library, where the main workhorse is (drum roll) Unison\\'s effect system called \"abilities\".\\n\\nWeâll see what can be checked at compile-time, what canât, how abilities are layered to provide different DSLs (domain-specific languages),\\nhow they can be used to enclose state for mutually recursive functions, etcâ¦\\n\\nFinally, I will talk about some of the issues that slowed me down during the development, and why I feel that a full-fledge\\nUnison IDE will be indispensable for any medium to large scale project.\\n\\n**Eric Torreborre**\\nI am a Rust/Elixir developer working at Ockam where we enable private systems to communicate without exposing their network to the Internet (ask me more if you\\'re interested!). I am also a functional programmer at heart, having professional experience with both Scala and Haskell which I enjoyed very much!\\n\\nBlog: [https://etorreborre.blog](https://etorreborre.blog)\\nX.com: [https://x.com/etorreborre](https://x.com/etorreborre)\\nBluesky: [https://bsky.app/profile/etorreborre.blog](https://bsky.app/profile/etorreborre.blog)\\n\\n**Dependent types are everywhere!**\\nHave you ever heard of dependent types? Even if you have not, chances are you have most likely encountered some data structure that is actually dependently typed, without knowing it. In this talk I will explain what dependent types are and why they are everywhere, we just donât notice them as we are so used to living without them. With dependent types we can express our structures more correctly, giving us more guarantees compile time. As a concrete example I will share my recent experience with writing a small questionnaire with a web frontend, all the parts of this construction that are actually dependently typed, and the differences between writing it with and without dependent types.\\n\\n**Elisabeth Stenholm**\\nElisabeth is 32 years old, born in Uppsala and raised in Stockholm. She has a PhD in dependent type theory from the University of Bergen, and is currently working as a fullstack developer at Frende Forsikring â a Norwegian insurance company based in Bergen. In her workday, Elisabeth writes primarily in the functional languages F# and Elm. She is passionate about type theory and functional programming, and enjoys sharing her knowledge on these topics with others.\\n\\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisabethstenholm/\\n\\n**Post-show chat**\\nOnce the live stream is over we will do a post show chat on the FPS Discord Server, where you can join and ask questions and meet more community members (this will no be recorded).\\n\\nInvite for the FPS Discord Server: [https://discord.gg/rMT6xRPwgZ](https://discord.gg/rMT6xRPwgZ)\\n\\n**Video sponsor â Ada Beat**\\n[https://adabeat.com](https://adabeat.com)\\n\\n**Merch**\\nIf you want to spread functional programming and support the channel, buy something from the shop:\\n[https://funcprogsweden.myspreadshop.net/](https://funcprogsweden.myspreadshop.net/)\\n\\n#funcprogsweden',\n",

       "   'description': 'With what is going on in the world right now I feel I have a lot of learning and thinking to do. For me that means listening to podcasts that explain stuff and reading more non fiction. Last week I came across a podcast that asked what âthe westâ is. Some of the answers came from this book and I was intrigued.\\nI am not the only one. NYT says about the book:\\nâAccording to Joseph Henrich, some unknown early church fathers about a thousand years later promulgated the edict: Donât marry your cousin! Why they did this is also unclear, but if Henrich is right â and he develops a fascinating case brimming with evidence â this prohibition changed the face of the world, by eventually creating societies and people that were WEIRD: Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic.\\n\\nIn the argument put forward in this engagingly written, excellently organized and meticulously argued book, this simple rule triggered a cascade of changes, creating states to replace tribes, science to replace lore and law to replace custom. If you are reading this you are very probably WEIRD, and so are almost all of your friends and associates, but we are outliers on many psychological measures.\\n\\nThe world today has billions of inhabitants who have minds strikingly different from ours. Roughly, we weirdos are individualistic, think analytically, believe in free will, take personal responsibility, feel guilt when we misbehave and think nepotism is to be vigorously discouraged, if not outlawed. Right? They (the non-WEIRD majority) identify more strongly with family, tribe, clan and ethnic group, think more âholistically,â take responsibility for what their group does (and publicly punish those who besmirch the groupâs honor), feel shame â not guilt â when they misbehave and think nepotism is a natural duty.â\\nI would be happy to be joined by lots of non-weird and weird people to discuss the first and then the second part with me.

Why they did this is also unclear, but if Henrich is right â and he develops a fascinating case brimming with evidence â this prohibition changed the face of the world, by eventually creating societies and people that were WEIRD: Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic.\\n\\nIn the argument put forward in this engagingly written, excellently organized and meticulously argued book, this simple rule triggered a cascade of changes, creating states to replace tribes, science to replace lore and law to replace custom. If you are reading this you are very probably WEIRD, and so are almost all of your friends and associates, but we are outliers on many psychological measures.\\n\\nThe world today has billions of inhabitants who have minds strikingly different from ours. Roughly, we weirdos are individualistic, think analytically, believe in free will, take personal responsibility, feel guilt when we misbehave and think nepotism is to be vigorously discouraged, if not outlawed. Right? They (the non-WEIRD majority) identify more strongly with family, tribe, clan and ethnic group, think more âholistically,â take responsibility for what their group does (and publicly punish those who besmirch the groupâs honor), feel shame â not guilt â when they misbehave and think nepotism is a natural duty.â\\nI would be happy to be joined by lots of non-weird and weird people to discuss the first and then the second part with me. Happy reading!',\n",

       "   'description': \"Are software engineers headed for the end of coding, or will they have more legacy mess to solve than ever? Is AI eliminating gig work or enhancing freelance opportunities for everyone? Will algorithmic bosses enslave human workers or free them from traditional management? Is AGI already here or can we wait a while longer? And what role will humans have in the future of work?\\n\\nThis session unpacks highlights from the new book **Human Robot Agent** so that we can explore dilemmas, navigate complexity, and harness AI to thrive in a socio-technological and wicked world.\\nLearning Objectives:\\n\\n1. Understand AI's Role in New Ways of Working: Identify how technology reshapes traditional business structures and ways of working.\\n2. Embrace Disruptive Innovation: Learn an actionable mindset to lead change and be the disruptor rather than embracing change and be the disrupted.\\n3. Cultivate New Skills and Mindsets: Explore the shift towards multi-skilled (M-skilled) workers, critical thinkers, and adaptive leaders in AI-driven environments.\\n\\n**About Jurgen Appelo**\\nJurgen Appelo is a radical synthesist, resolute unfixer, and unabashed rule-breaker. He not only brings together diverse perspectives in organization design and developmentâhe tears them apart and rebuilds them for the Age of AI, without permission.\\nAs an author, speaker, and entrepreneur, Jurgen helps leaders stop managing like it's 2001 and start rewiring their organizations for AI-driven leadership, autonomous digital agents, and algorithmic management. Through stories, games, tools, and practices, he shatters conventional thinking and gets his audience to experiment with human-AI teamwork, anti-fragile structures, and the unpredictable nature of customer and employee experience.\\nInc.com recognized him as a [Top 50 Leadership Expert](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-top-50-leadership-and-management-experts-mon.html) and [Top 100 Leadership Speaker](https://www.inc.com/kevin-kruse/the-top-100-leadership-speakers-for-2018.html), but he's most interested in redrawing the boundaries between opposing worldviews: human ingenuity and artificial intelligence, inspiring leadership versus strong governance, organizational stability with relentless innovation, and individual growth fuelling collective success.\\nHis books tackle everything from the role of agile managers ([Management 3.0](https://jurgenappelo.com/pages/management30)) to change and transformation ([How to Change the World](https://jurgenappelo.com/pages/how-to-change-the-world/)), and from employee engagement ([Managing for Happiness](https://jurgenappelo.com/pages/managing-for-happiness/)) to innovation and intrapreneurship ([Startup, Scaleup, Screwup](https://jurgenappelo.com/pages/startup-scaleup-screwup)). Even his novel [Glitches of Gods](https://jurgenappelo.com/pages/glitches-of-gods) explores the chaos of human-machine interactions. His latest work, [Human Robot Agent](https://jurgenappelo.com/pages/human-robot-agent), plunges into the AI-powered future of leadership and algorithmic management.\\nAs founder of [The unFIX Company](https://unfix.com/) (and previously founder of [Management 3.0](https://management30.com/) and co-founder of the [Agile Lean Europe](https://agilelean.eu/) network), Jurgen keeps pioneering the future of work.\\n\\n\\\\*Please note: This event will be recorded.\",\n",

       "   'title': 'The Pandemic 5 Years On: How Covid Changed Our Friendships, And How We Can Heal',\n",
       "   'description': \"2025 marks five years since the Covid pandemic led to a global lockdown. Which - at a time when we most needed connection - cut us off from those closest to us, and left many people fending for themselves. We're only just starting to understand the seismic changes to our lives, our relationships, and our society caused by the pandemic. But it's clear that these have been significant and long lasting.\\n\\nIn this session, we'll look at the impact on our friendships, and other close relationships in particular. Why did the pandemic have such a profound affect on these relationships? Is the damage that was done reversible? Have we really moved on - and what do we need to do to regain a sense of safety, control and connectedness - to ourselves, to other people, and to the world around us?\\n\\nIf you're someone who feels as though 'doing life' has felt harder since the pandemic, that your friendships & other close relationships were affected and haven't been the same since, and / or that you just don't have the energy any more to socialise in the way you did prior to 2020, then this impactful session will shed new light\\n\\nWe are expecting this event to be very popular, and we would ask all attendees to please respect the facilitators' instructions, so that we can ensure the event runs smoothly for all.\\n\\n**What** **is a Friendshift Open Event?**\\nFriendshift by friendship coach Hannah Carmichael OBE is a small business offering courses, workshops, programmes and coaching services for thoughtful, reflective types (think friendly introverts!) who want more from their friendships.\\n\\nPart of the Friendshift mission is to make it normal to talk about friendship, and our Open Events are a part of that mission! Open Events are completely free to attend, and are held every two weeks on a Wednesday lunchtime (UK time / GMT). Each Open Event covers a different aspect of modern friendship, and topics are usually prompted by conversations between Hannah and her clients, or previous attendees!\\n\\n**PLEASE NOTE that all sessions are recorded, and AI transcripted.**\\n**Slides and / or recordings are shared afterwards by email, and extracts may be used on social media and elsewhere. We will seek permission from those who feature where possible, but this cannot be guaranteed.**\\n\\n**Who is it for?**\\nHannah's events tend attract thoughtful, reflective, independent types - most of whom are aged over 30 and prefer to connect in more stereotypically introverted / lower-key ways. But you don't have to be this demographic to attend - if the topic sounds interesting and useful to you, and you want to find out more about building better friendships in a safe, supportive space, then you are very welcome to join.\\n\\n**Why should I attend?**\\n\\n* A chance to hear from other people who are on the same learning journey as you.\\n* Walk away with practical, evidence-based advice\\n* Opportunity to seek advice and support on friendship issues that you're facing\\n* Safe, welcoming, introvert-friendly spaces\\n\\n**What if I'm worried about talking on camera / taking part?**\\nIt's absolutely fine to get involved in Friendshift Open Events in whatever way feels most comfortable for you. We're very introvert-friendly! Sessions are interactive, with plenty of opportunities to contribute and ask questions via the chat, and by coming on camera. And because we deal with real life issues, everyone benefits when ideas and experiences are shared. But if you'd prefer to listen in with your camera off, that's absolutely fine too. Participants are sometimes offered the chance to breakout into smaller groups to aid learning - if this is part of the session plan, it will be mentioned at the start to give you time to decide if you would like to take part.\\n\\n**Your Facilitator**\\nHannah Carmichael OBE is a mum-of-one with ADHD and a serious coffee addiction. She is also a leading expert and sought-after coach specialising in friendship & connection, and is regularly featured in publications such as Stylist, Psychology Today, The Guardian, and BBC World Service. She is an expert panellist for BBC Radios Oxford & Berkshire. As a reformed 'awkward type,' Hannah loves nothing more than to see her clients recognising their worth and value, finding the confidence to show up fully as themselves, transforming their friendships, and building deep, authentic, wholehearted connections in all aspects of their lives.\",\n",

It's still a chance to learn and understand by witnessing others facing similar challenges\\n* Q&A session\\n\\n**Your chance**\\nCoaching is a great opportunity to have more clarity by light bulbs going off, to find your blind spots and save a lot of time and energy.\\n\\n**The Rules (yeah we Germans love them)**\\n\\n* This is an event for men, who act with respect and are willing to support each other.\\n* Be aware that you'll be expected to have your video on.

Typically, the personal subjects raised during the check-ins are looked at more closely, but new matters are welcome too. Before a woman can speak, she needs to indicate to the host that she wants to jump in.\\n\\nAny woman is free to decline being the topic of discussion.\\n\\nKelda is a confidential group. This is the only rule and it concerns both the contents of the meeting and the identity of the women.\\n\\nYou are requested to arrive on time, stay for the duration of the meeting, enable your camera, and find a room where no family members or roommates will be present.\\n\\nPlease review [the \"About\" section](https://www.meetup.com/keldagroup/), too.\\n\\n\\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~ \\\\~\\n\\n\\\\~ self-image \\\\~ purpose \\\\~ shame \\\\~ being overwhelmed \\\\~ accomplishments \\\\~ the female identity \\\\~ moral dilemmas \\\\~ course of life \\\\~ work \\\\~ harassment \\\\~ stress \\\\~ recognition \\\\~ ambition \\\\~ relationships \\\\~ loneliness \\\\~ sex \\\\~ family \\\\~ health \\\\~ discord \\\\~ belonging \\\\~ responsibilities \\\\~\\n\\n**\\\\* Important: Temporarily, and in response to requests, the group will be hosted and coordinated by Tristan, who is male.

Feel welcome to have and disclose deep-rooted personal feelings.\\n\\nIn our women\\'s group, we cut through pretence and look at ourselves \"in the mirror.\" We\\'ll take a close look at everything in a safe atmosphere. Here, youâll gain the perspectives of fellow women and the wisdom of the group. This is a confidential place for real support: a place to examine issues in yourself, your relationships, your work, and so on.\\n\\n**WHO WE ARE**\\nWe\\'re not a forum for public issues and advocacy. We are also not a replacement for mental health support. We are just normal womenâof all ages and races, with various backgrounds and ambitions, and without any shared affiliation to a religion or school of thought.\\n\\n**BEING CHALLENGED**\\nWe value authenticity in others and ourselves. If someone feels you are not being genuine, forthcoming, or realistic, then you might get feedback about that (if you are open to it). It\\'ll be a measured and caring challenge to look at things differently, or be accountable.\\n\\n**BEING IN A GROUP**\\nAnother element that you may come to appreciate is learning how to be part of a group, a sisterhood. How to make decisions together and notice what role you have, or how others see you. Collisions will occur, but that is okay; let\\'s talk about them. Let\\'s really figure things out. Our group is a safe space where we can learn to sit in conflict and not lose our voices.\\n\\nCome meet our women and witness the inestimable connection we share. You can expect us to be interested in your story and to respond with curiosity; your willingness to speak will be valued. Tell us what\\'s going on for you, what it\\'s like to be in your situation, and what it\\'s like to be you: a strong woman, possibly in a tough spot.\\n\\nCome and speak the unspoken.
